R2D2,R2D2,3,,1,12,
CAPTAIN TYPHO,PADME,4,"We made it. I guess I was wrong, there was no danger at all.",2,14,
PADME,CORDE,5,Corde...,1,1,
CORDE,PADME,6,"M'lady I'm so sorry. I've failed you, Senator",1,8,
PADME,CORDE,7,No!,1,1,
CAPTAIN TYPHO,PADME,8,"M'Lady, you are still in danger here.",1,7,
PADME,CAPTAIN TYPHO,9,I shouldn't have come back.,1,5,
CAPTAIN TYPHO,PADME,10,"This vote is very important. You did your duty and Corde did hers. Now come. Senator Amidala, please!",5,18,
PALPATINE,"YODA, MACE WINDU, KI-ADI-MUNDI",11,"I don't know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. More and more star systems are joining the separatists.",3,23,
MACE WINDU,PALPATINE,12,If they do break away-,1,5,
PALPATINE,"YODA, MACE WINDU, KI-ADI-MUNDI",13,I will not let this Republic... that has stood for a thousand years be split in two. My negotiations will not fail.,2,22,
MACE WINDU,PALPATINE,14,"If they do, you must realize there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We're keepers of the peace, not soldiers.",2,21,
PALPATINE,YODA,15,Master Yoda. Do you think it will really come to war?,1,11,
YODA,PALPATINE,16,The dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see the future is.,2,11,
PALPATINE,NA,17,Good. Send them in.,1,4,
PALPATINE,"YODA, MACE WINDU, KI-ADI-MUNDI",18,We will discuss this matter later.,1,6,
YODA,PADME,19,"Senator Amidala, Your tragedy on the landing platform, terrible. Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart. brings warm feeling to my heart.",3,24,
PADME,YODA,20,Do you have any idea who was behind this attack?,3,10,
MACE WINDU,PADME,21,"Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, in the moons of Naboo.",3,12,
PADME,MACE WINDU,22,I think that Count Dooku was behind it.,2,8,
KI-ADI-MUNDI,PADME,23,"He is a political idealist, not a murderer.",2,8,
MACE WINDU,PADME,24,"You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He couldn't assassinate anyone, it's not in his character.",4,18,
YODA,PADME,25,"But for certain Senator, in grave danger you are.",2,9,
PALPATINE,"YODA, MACE WINDU, KI-ADI-MUNDI",26,"Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces.",3,16,
BAIL ORGANA,PALPATINE,27,Do you really think that's a wise decision under these stressful times?,3,13,
PADME,PALPATINE,28,"Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe that the...",2,11,
PALPATINE,PADME,29,"...""situation is that serious."" No, but I do, Senator. I realize all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... Master Kenobi...",7,35,
MACE WINDU,PALPATINE,30,That's possible. He's just returned from a border dispute on Ansion.,3,11,
PALPATINE,PADME,31,"Do it for me, M'Lady... please, the thought of losing you is unbearable",3,13,
MACE WINDU,PADME,32,"I'll have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, M'Lady.",2,8,
PADME,MACE WINDU,33,Thank you Master Windu,1,4,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,34,You seem a little on edge,1,6,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,35,Not at all,1,3,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,36,I haven't felt you this tense since we fell into that nest of Gundarks,1,14,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,37,"You fell into that nightmare, master And I rescued you remember?",2,11,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,38,"Oh.. yes. You're sweating, relax, take a deep breath.",1,9,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,39,"I haven't seen her in ten years, Master.",1,8,
JAR JAR,OBI-WAN,40,Obi? Obi! Mesa sooo smilen to see'en yousa.,2,8,
OBI-WAN,JAR JAR,41,"Good to see you, again, Jar Jar.",1,7,
JAR JAR,PADME,42,"Senator Padme! Mesa Palos Here! Lookie, lookie, Senator desa jedi arriven",4,11,
OBI-WAN,PADME,43,"It's a great pleasure to see you again, M'Lady.",2,9,
PADME,OBI-WAN,44,It has been far too long Master Kenobi.,2,8,
PADME,ANAKIN,45,Ani?? My goodness you've grown.,2,5,
ANAKIN,PADME,46,"So have you... grown more beautiful, I mean... well... for a Senator, I mean.",3,14,
PADME,ANAKIN,47,"Ani, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.",2,11,
OBI-WAN,PADME,48,"Our presence will be invisible, M'Lady. I can assure you",2,10,
CAPTAIN TYPHO,OBI-WAN,49,"I'm Captain Typho of Her Majesty's security service. Queen Jamilla has been informed of your assignment. I am grateful you're here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit.",5,33,
PADME,"CAPTAIN TYPHO, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN",50,"I don't need more security, I need answers. I want to know who is trying to kill me.",3,18,
OBI-WAN,PADME,51,"We're here to protect you Senator, not to start an investigation.",3,11,
ANAKIN,PADME,52,"We will find out who is trying to kill you Padme, I promise you.",2,14,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,53,"We will not exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner.",2,10,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,54,"I meant that in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course.",2,12,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,55,"We will not going through this exercise again, Anakin. And you will pay attention to my lead.",3,17,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,56,Why?,1,1,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,57,What??!!,1,1,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,58,"Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security... not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.",7,34,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,59,"We will do exactly as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one.",3,17,
PADME,"OBI-WAN, ANAKIN",60,"Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed. Now if you will excuse me I will retire.",4,22,
CAPTAIN TYPHO,OBI-WAN,61,I know I'll feel a lot better having you here. I'll have an officer stationed on every floor and I'll be in the control center downstairs.,5,26,
JAR JAR,ANAKIN,62,"Mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, Ani.",2,8,
ANAKIN,JAR JAR,63,"She hardly even recognized me, Jar Jar. I thought about her every day since we parted... and she's forgotten me completely.",4,21,
JAR JAR,ANAKIN,64,Shesa happy. Happier den mesa see-en her in a longo time.,2,11,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,65,"You're focusing on the negative, Anakin. Be mindful of your thoughts. She was pleased to see us. Now lets check the security.",4,22,
ZAM WESSEL,JANGO FETT,66,I hit the ship but they used a decoy,1,9,
JANGO FETT,ZAM WESSEL,67,"We'll have to try something more subtle this time, Zam. My client is getting impatient. Take these. Be careful. They're very poisonous. Zam, there can be no mistakes this time.",3,30,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,68,Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin will try that way. Any activity up here?,3,18,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,69,Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.,3,16,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,70,What's going on?,1,3,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,71,She covered the cameras. I don't think she liked me watching her.,2,12,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,72,What is she thinking?,1,4,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,73,She programmed Artoo to warn us if there's an intruder.,2,10,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,74,There are many other ways to kill a Senator.,2,9,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,75,"I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don't we, Master?",2,13,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,76,You're using her as bait?,1,5,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,77,"It was her idea... Don't worry, no harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.",4,23,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,78,"It's too risky... besides, your senses aren't that attuned, my young apprentice.",2,12,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,79,And yours are?,1,3,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,80,Possibly. You look tired.,2,4,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,81,"I don't sleep well, anymore.",1,5,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,82,Because of your mother?,1,4,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,83,I don't know why I keep dreaming bbout her.,2,9,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,84,Dreams pass in time.,1,4,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,85,I'd much rather dream about Padme. Just being around her again is... intoxicating.,3,13,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,86,"Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. You've made a commitment to the Jedi order... a commitment not easily broken... and don't forget she's a politician and they're not to be trusted.",6,34,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,87,"She's not like the others in the Senate, Master.",2,9,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,88,It's been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they are in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy in order to get those funds.,7,35,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,89,"Not another lecture, Master. At least not on the economics of politics....",2,12,
R2D2,R2D2,90,,1,11,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,91,"And besides, you're generalizing. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.",4,11,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,92,"Palpatine is a politician, I have observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators.",4,21,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,93,I think he's a good man. My-,1,7,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,94,"I sense it, too.",1,4,
ANAKIN,PADME,95,Stay here!,1,2,
DORME,PADME,96,"Are you all right, m'lady?",1,5,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,97,What took you so long?,1,5,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,98,"Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder that I really liked,",2,13,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,99,There he is,1,3,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,100,with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities...,2,10,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,101,If you spent as much time practicing your saber techniques as you do on your wit you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.,5,24,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,102,I thought I already did.,1,5,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,103,"Only in your mind, my very young apprentice. Pull up, Anakin. Pull up! You know I don't like it when you do that.",2,23,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,104,"Sorry, Master, I forgot you don't like flying.",2,8,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,105,I don't mind flying... but what you're doing is suicide! Anakin! How many times have I told you stay away from power couplings! That was good. Where are you going?! He went that way.,7,34,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,106,"Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep's gonna end up deep fried. Personally, I'd very much like to find out who he is and who he's working for... This is a shortcut. I think.",6,36,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,107,"Well, you've lost him.",1,4,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,108,"I'm deeply sorry, Master.",1,4,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,109,"That was some shortcut, Anakin. He went completely the other way. Once again you've proved...",2,15,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,110,If you'll excuse me.,1,4,
OBI-WAN,OBI-WAN,111,I hate it when he does that.,1,7,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,112,Anakin!,1,1,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,113,"She went into the club, Master.",1,6,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,114,Patience. Use the Force. Think.,2,5,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,115,"Sorry, Master.",1,2,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,116,"He went in there to hide, not to run.",1,9,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,117,"Yes, Master.",1,2,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,118,"Next time, try not to lose it.",1,7,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,119,"Yes, Master.",1,2,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,120,This weapon is your life.,1,5,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,121,"I try, Master.",1,3,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,122,Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the death of me?!,2,14,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,123,Don't say that Master... You're the closest thing I have to a father...,3,13,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,124,Then why don't you listen to me?!,1,7,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,125,I am trying,1,3,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,126,Can you see him?,1,4,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,127,I think he is a she... And I think she is a changeling,1,13,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,128,"In that case, extra careful... Go and find her.",2,9,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,129,"Where are you going, Master?",1,5,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,130,For a drink.,1,3,
OBI-WAN,NA,131,Thank you.,1,2,
ELAN,OBI-WAN,132,You wanna buy some death sticks?,1,6,
OBI-WAN,ELAN,133,You don't want to sell me death-sticks.,2,8,
ELAN,OBI-WAN,134,I don't want to sell you death sticks.,2,8,
OBI-WAN,ELAN,135,You want to go home and rethink your life.,2,9,
ELAN,OBI-WAN,136,I want to go home and rethink my life.,2,9,
ANAKIN,NA,137,Easy... Jedi business. Go back to your drinks.,2,8,
OBI-WAN,ZAM WESSEL,138,Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?,2,11,
ZAM WESSEL,"OBI-WAN, ANAKIN",139,The Senator from Naboo.,1,4,
OBI-WAN,ZAM WESSEL,140,And who hired you?,1,4,
ZAM WESSEL,OBI-WAN,141,It was just a job.,1,5,
ANAKIN,ZAM WESSEL,142,"Who hired you, tell us. Tell us now!",1,8,
ZAM WESSEL,ANAKIN,143,It was a bounty hunter called...,1,6,
ZAM WESSEL,"OBI-WAN, ANAKIN",144,Wee shahnit ... sleemo,1,3,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,145,Toxic dart...,1,2,
YODA,OBI-WAN,146,"Track down this bounty hunter you must, Obi-Wan.",1,8,
MACE WINDU,OBI-WAN,147,"Most importantly, find out who he's working for.",1,8,
OBI-WAN,"MACE WINDU, YODA",148,What about Senator Amidala? She will still need protecting.,2,9,
YODA,OBI-WAN,149,Handle that your Padawan will.,1,5,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,150,"Anakin, escort the senator back to her home planet of Naboo. She'll be safer there. And don't use registered transport. Travel as refugees.",4,23,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,151,"As the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult... to get Senator Amidala to leave the capital.",2,19,
YODA,ANAKIN,152,Until caught this killer is... our judgment she must respect.,1,10,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,153,"Anakin, go to the senate... and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter.",1,16,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,154,I will talk with her. Senator Amidala will not refuse an executive order. I know her well enough to assure you of that.,2,23,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,155,"Thank you, Your Excellency.",1,4,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,156,"And so, they've finally given you an assignment. Your patience has paid off",1,13,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,157,Your guidance more than my patience.,1,6,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,158,"You don't need guidance, Anakin. In time, you will learn to trust your feelings. Then you will be invincible. I have said it many times: You are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.",4,35,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,159,"Thank you, Your Excellency.",1,4,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,160,"I see you becoming the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin.. even more powerful than Master Yoda.",2,17,
OBI-WAN,"YODA, MACE WINDU",161,I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet.,2,19,
YODA,OBI-WAN,162,"The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan.",2,8,
MACE WINDU,OBI-WAN,163,The boy has exceptional skills.,1,5,
OBI-WAN,"YODA, MACE WINDU",164,"But he still has much to learn, Master. And his abilities have made him... well... arrogant.",3,16,
YODA,OBI-WAN,165,"Yes, yes. A flaw more and more common among Jedi. Too sure of themselves they are. Even the older, more experienced ones.",6,22,
MACE WINDU,OBI-WAN,166,"Remember, Obi-Wan, if the prophecy is true... your apprentice is the only one who can bring the Force back into balance.",4,21,
PADME,JAR JAR,167,"I'm taking an extended leave of absence. It will be your responsibility to take my place in the Senate. Representative Binks, I know I can count on you.",3,28,
JAR JAR,PADME,168,"Mesa honored to be taking on dissa heavy burden. burden. Mesa accept this with muy, muy humility and--",4,18,
PADME,JAR JAR,169,"Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up. I'm sure you have a great deal to do.",2,17,
JAR JAR,PADME,170,"Of course, M'lady.",1,3,
PADME,ANAKIN,171,I do not like this idea of hiding.,1,8,
ANAKIN,PADME,172,"Don't worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find this bounty hunter.",4,21,
PADME,ANAKIN,173,I haven't worked for a year to defeat the Military Creation Act... to not be here when its fate is decided.,4,21,
ANAKIN,PADME,174,Sometimes we must let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.,3,15,
PADME,ANAKIN,175,"Anakin, you've grown up.",2,4,
ANAKIN,PADME,176,Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it. Don't get me wrong. Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and... as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. In some ways-- a lot of ways-- I'm really ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials... but he feels that I'm too unpredictable. He won't let me move on.,15,65,
PADME,ANAKIN,177,That must be frustrating.,1,4,
ANAKIN,PADME,178,It's worse. He's overly critical. He never listens. He doesn't understand. It's not fair!,5,14,
PADME,ANAKIN,179,All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.,3,21,
ANAKIN,PADME,180,I know.,1,2,
PADME,ANAKIN,181,Anakin.,1,1,
PADME,ANAKIN,182,Don't try to grow up too fast.,1,7,
ANAKIN,ANAKIN,183,But I am grown up. You said it yourself.,2,9,
PADME,ANAKIN,184,Please don't look at me like that.,2,7,
ANAKIN,PADME,185,Why not?,1,2,
PADME,ANAKIN,186,It makes me feel uncomfortable.,1,5,
ANAKIN,PADME,187,"Sorry, milady.",1,2,
CAPTAIN TYPHO,PADME,188,"Be safe, m'lady.",1,3,
PADME,"CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORME",189,"Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorme. The threat's on you two now.",3,14,
DORME,"PADME, CAPTAIN TYPHO",190,He'll be safe with me.,1,5,
PADME,DORME,191,You'll be fine.,1,3,
DORME,PADME,192,"It's not me, m'lady. I worry about you. What if they realize you've left the capital?",3,16,
PADME,DORME,193,"Well, then my Jedi protector will have to prove how good he is.",2,13,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,194,Anakin. Don't do anything without first consulting either myself or the council.,3,12,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,195,"Yes, Master.",1,2,
OBI-WAN,PADME,196,"I'll get to the bottom of this plot quickly, milady. You'll be back here in no time.",4,17,
PADME,OBI-WAN,197,"I'll be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.",2,9,
ANAKIN,PADME,198,It's time to go.,1,4,
PADME,ANAKIN,199,I know.,1,2,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,200,"Anakin, may the Force be with you.",2,7,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,201,"May the Force be with you, Master.",2,7,
PADME,ANAKIN,202,Suddenly I'm afraid.,1,3,
ANAKIN,PADME,203,This is my first assignment on my own. I am too. Don't worry. We have Artoo with us.,4,18,
R2D2,"PADME, ANAKIN",204,,1,3,
OBI-WAN,CAPTAIN TYPHO,205,I do hope he doesn't try anything foolish.,2,8,
CAPTAIN TYPHO,OBI-WAN,206,I'd be more concerned about her doing something than him.,2,10,
HERMIONE,DEXTER JETTSTER,207,"Someone to see ya, honey Jedi, by the looks of him.",2,11,
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,208,Obi-wan!,1,1,
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,209,"Hello, Dex.",1,2,
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,210,Take a seat! I'll be right with ya!,1,8,
HERMIONE,OBI-WAN,211,You want a cup of jawa juice?,1,7,
OBI-WAN,HERMIONE,212,"Oh, yes. Thank you.",1,4,
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,213,"Hey, ol' buddy! So, my friend. What can I do for ya?",3,12,
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,214,You can tell me what this is.,1,7,
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,215,"Well, whattaya know... I ain't seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the Outer Rim!",4,19,
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,216,Can you tell me where it came from?,1,8,
OBI-WAN,HERMIONE,217,Thank you.,1,2,
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,218,This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino saberdart.,3,14,
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,219,I wonder why it didn't show up in the analysis archive.,3,11,
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,220,"It's these funny little cuts on the side that give it away... Those analysis droids only focus on symbols, I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom.",8,35,
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,221,"Well, if droids could think there'd be none of us here, would there? Kamino... I'm not familiar with it. Is it in the Republic?",4,24,
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,222,"No, no, it's beyond the Outer Rim. I'd say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze Should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archives. These Kaminoans keep to themselves. They're cloners. Damned good ones, too.",8,39,
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,223,Cloners? Are they friendly?,1,4,
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,224,"oh, depends.",1,2,
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,225,"Depends on what, Dex?",1,4,
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,226,On how good your manners are... and how big your pocketbook is...,2,12,
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,227,Did you call for assistance?,1,5,
OBI-WAN,JOCASTA NU,228,"Yes... yes, I did...",1,4,
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,229,"Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?",1,7,
OBI-WAN,JOCASTA NU,230,"Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system called Kamino.",2,9,
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,231,Kamino?,1,1,
OBI-WAN,JOCASTA NU,232,It doesn't show up on the archive charts.,2,8,
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,233,Kamino. It's not a system I'm familiar with. Are you sure you have the right coordinates?,2,16,
OBI-WAN,JOCASTA NU,234,"According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here... just south of the Rishi Maze.",2,17,
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,235,"I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for... doesn't exist.",3,16,
OBI-WAN,JOCASTA NU,236,Impossible. Perhaps the archives are incomplete.,2,6,
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,237,If an item does not appear in our records... it does not exist.,3,13,
FOOD SERVER,R2D2,238,Hey you! No Droids!,1,4,

ANAKIN,PADME,246,Or be with the people that I love.,2,8,
PADME,ANAKIN,247,Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.,3,13,
ANAKIN,PADME,248,"Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love... is central to a Jedi's life. So you might say that we are encouraged to love.",8,30,
PADME,ANAKIN,249,You've changed so much.,1,4,
ANAKIN,PADME,250,You haven't changed a bit.,1,5,
ANAKIN,ANAKIN,251,You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams.,2,10,
YODA,YOUNGLINGS,252,Reach out. Sense the Force around you. Use your feelings you must. Younglings. Younglings! A visitor we have.,6,18,
YOUNGLINGS,OBI-WAN,253,"Hello, Master Obi-Wan.",1,3,
OBI-WAN,YOUNGLINGS,254,Hello.,1,1,
OBI-WAN,YODA,255,"I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.",1,6,
YODA,OBI-WAN,256,"What help can I be, Obi-Wan?",2,6,
OBI-WAN,YODA,257,"I'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him, but the systems don't show on the archive maps.",4,24,
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",258,"Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing. How embarrassing. Liam, the shades. Gather round the map reader. Clear your minds... and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will.",10,28,
OBI-WAN,YODA,259,It ought to be... here... but it isn't. Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot.,4,20,
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",260,Hmm. Gravity's silhouette remains... but the star and all the planets... disappeared they have. How can this be? Hmm? A thought? Anyone.,8,22,
BOY,YODA,261,Master? Because someone erased it from the archive memory.,3,9,
YODA,OBI-WAN,262,Truly wonderful the mind of a child is. The Padawan is right. Go to the center of gravity's pull... and find your planet you will. The data must have been erased.,9,31,
OBI-WAN,YODA,263,"But, Master Yoda, who could empty information from the archives? That's impossible, isn't it?",3,14,
YODA,OBI-WAN,264,"Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is. Only a Jedi could have erased those files. But who and why, harder to answer. Meditate on this I will.",7,26,
PADME,ANAKIN,265,"I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected... but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.",6,28,
ANAKIN,PADME,266,The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they even tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office.,5,25,
PADME,ANAKIN,267,I was relieved when my two terms were up. But when the queen asked me to serve as senator... I couldn't refuse her.,5,23,
ANAKIN,PADME,268,I agree with her. I think the Republic needs you. I'm glad that you chose to serve.,4,17,
PADME,"SIO BIBBLE, QUEEN JAMILLIA",269,If the senate votes to create an army... I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.,4,19,
SIO BIBBLE,PADME,270,It's unthinkable. There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic.,3,14,
QUEEN JAMILLIA,PADME,271,Do you see any way through negotiations... to bring the separatists back into the Republic?,4,15,
PADME,QUEEN JAMILLIA,272,Not if they feel threatened. My guess is they'll turn to the Trade Federations or the Commerce Guilds for help.,4,20,
SIO BIBBLE,"PADME, QUEEN JAMILLIA",273,"It's outrageous, but after four trials in the Supreme Court... Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation. I fear the senate is powerless to resolve this crisis.",6,30,
QUEEN JAMILLIA,"PADME, SIO BIBBLE",274,We must keep our faith in the Republic.,2,8,
QUEEN JAMILLIA,PADME,275,The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.,2,14,
PADME,QUEEN JAMILLIA,276,Let's pray that day never comes.,2,6,
QUEEN JAMILLIA,PADME,277,"In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.",2,9,
SIO BIBBLE,ANAKIN,278,"What is your suggestion,",1,4,
SIO BIBBILE,ANAKIN,279,Master Jedi?,1,2,
PADME,SIO BIBBILE,280,"Oh, Anakin's not a Jedi yet. He's still a Padawan learner.",3,11,
PADME,QUEEN JAMILLIA,281,But I was thinking--,1,4,
ANAKIN,PADME,282,Hold on a minute.,1,4,
PADME,ANAKIN,283,Excuse me.,1,2,
PADME,QUEEN JAMILLIA,284,I was thinking I would stay in the lake country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.,4,20,
ANAKIN,PADME,285,"Excuse me. I'm in charge of security here, milady.",2,9,
PADME,ANAKIN,286,And this is my home. I know it very well. That is why we're here. I think it would be wise if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance.,5,31,
ANAKIN,PADME,287,"Sorry, milady.",1,2,
QUEEN JAMILLIA,PADME,288,"Perfect. It's settled, then.",1,4,
OBI-WAN,R4,289,"There it is, R4, right where it should be. Our missing planet Kamino.",2,13,
TAUN WE,OBI-WAN,290,Master Jedi. The prime minister is expecting you.,2,8,
OBI-WAN,TAUN WE,291,I'm expected?,1,2,
TAUN WE,OBI-WAN,292,"Of course. He is anxious to meet you. After all these years... we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now, please, this way.",6,24,
TAUN WE,"LAMA SU, OBI-WAN",293,May I present Lama Su... prime minister of Kamino. And this is Master Jedi--,3,14,
OBI-WAN,"LAMA SU, TAUN WE",294,Obi-Wan Kenobi.,1,2,
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,295,"I trust you're going to enjoy your stay. Please. And now to business. You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule. 200,000 units are ready... with a million more well on the way.",9,36,
OBI-WAN,"LAMA SU, TAUN WE",296,That's good news.,1,3,
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,297,Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas... that his order will be met on time.,4,13,
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,298,I'm sorry. Master--,1,3,
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,299,Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still a leading member of the Jedi Council... is he not?,3,15,
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,300,Master Sifo-Dyas was killed almost ten years ago.,2,8,
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,301,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. But I'm sure he would have been proud of the army we've built for him.",4,22,
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,302,The army?,1,2,
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,303,"Yes. A clone army, and I must say, one of the finest we've ever created.",3,15,
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,304,"Tell me, Prime Minister... when my master first contacted you about the army... did he say who it was for?",5,20,
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,305,Of course he did. This army is for the Republic. But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.,5,21,
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,306,That's why I'm here.,1,4,
PADME,ANAKIN,307,We used to come here for school retreat. We would swim to that island every day. I love the water. We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.,9,44,
ANAKIN,PADME,308,"I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating... and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here, everything is soft... and smooth.",7,23,
PADME,ANAKIN,309,No. I shouldn't have done that.,2,6,
ANAKIN,PADME,310,I'm sorry.,1,2,
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,311,Very impressive.,1,2,
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,312,I'd hoped you would be pleased. Clones can think creatively. You will find that they are immensely superior to droids. We take great pride in our combat education and training programs. This group was created about five years ago.,8,39,
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,313,You mentioned growth acceleration.,2,4,
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,314,"Oh,yes, it's essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now we can do it in half the time.",5,22,
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,315,I see.,1,2,
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,316,They are totally obedient... taking any order without question. We modified their genetic structure... to make them less independent than the original host.,7,23,
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,317,And who was the original host?,2,6,
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,318,A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.,2,6,
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,319,And where is this bounty hunter now?,2,7,
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,320,"Oh, we keep him here. Apart from his pay, which is considerable... Fett demanded only one thing: an unaltered clone for himself. Curious, isn't it?",8,25,
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,321,Unaltered?,1,1,
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,322,Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration.,4,17,
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,323,I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett.,2,10,
TAUN WE,OBI-WAN,324,I would be very happy to arrange it.,2,8,
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,325,"Magnificent, aren't they?",1,3,
PADME,ANAKIN,326,I don't know.,1,3,
ANAKIN,PADME,327,Sure you do. You just don't want to tell me.,2,10,
PADME,ANAKIN,328,You gonna use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?,2,11,
ANAKIN,PADME,329,They only work on the weak-minded.,2,6,
PADME,ANAKIN,330,"All right. I was twelve. His name was Palo. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older than I. Very cute. Dark, curly hair. Dreamy eyes.",8,32,
ANAKIN,PADME,331,"All right, I get the picture. Whatever happened to him?",2,10,
PADME,ANAKIN,332,I went into public service; he went on to become an artist.,2,12,
ANAKIN,PADME,333,Maybe he was the smart one.,1,6,
PADME,ANAKIN,334,"You really don't like politicians, do you?",2,7,
ANAKIN,PADME,335,I like two or three... but I'm not really sure about one of them. I don't think the system works.,5,20,
PADME,ANAKIN,336,How would you have it work?,2,6,
ANAKIN,PADME,337,"We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem... agree what's in the best interest of all the people, and then do it.",4,27,
PADME,ANAKIN,338,That's exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't always agree.,4,13,
ANAKIN,PADME,339,"Well, then they should be made to.",2,7,
PADME,ANAKIN,340,By whom? Who's gonna make them?,1,6,
ANAKIN,PADME,341,I don't know. Someone.,1,4,
PADME,ANAKIN,342,You?,1,1,
ANAKIN,PADME,343,Of course not me.,1,4,
PADME,ANAKIN,344,But someone.,1,2,
ANAKIN,PADME,345,Someone wise.,1,2,
PADME,ANAKIN,346,Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.,2,9,
ANAKIN,PADME,347,"Well, if it works.",1,4,
PADME,ANAKIN,348,You're making fun of me.,1,5,
ANAKIN,PADME,349,No. I'd be much too frightened to tease a senator.,3,10,
ANAKIN,NA,350,"Whoa, whoa. Oh, whoa!",1,4,
PADME,ANAKIN,351,"Ani! Ani, are you all right?",1,6,
TAUN WE,BOBA FETT,352,"Boba, is your father here?",1,5,
BOBA FETT,TAUN WE,353,Yep.,1,1,
TAUN WE,BOBA FETT,354,May we see him?,1,4,
BOBA FETT,TAUN WE,355,Sure.,1,1,
BOBA FETT,JANGO FETT,356,"Dad, Taun We's here.",1,4,
TAUN WE,JANGO FETT,357,"Jango, welcome back. Was your trip productive?",2,7,
JANGO FETT,TAUN WE,358,Fairly.,1,1,
TAUN WE,JANGO FETT,359,This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. He's come to check on our progress.,4,13,
OBI-WAN,JANGO FETT,360,Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud.,2,10,
JANGO FETT,OBI-WAN,361,I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe.,2,13,
OBI-WAN,JANGO FETT,362,Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?,2,11,
JANGO FETT,OBI-WAN,363,Once or twice.,1,3,
OBI-WAN,JANGO FETT,364,Recently?,1,1,
JANGO FETT,OBI-WAN,365,Possibly.,1,1,
OBI-WAN,JANGO FETT,366,Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas.,2,6,
JANGO FETT,BOBA FETT,367,"Boba, rood eht so-heeck.",2,4,
JANGO FETT,OBI-WAN,368,Master who?,1,2,
OBI-WAN,JANGO FETT,369,Sifo-Dyas. Is he not the Jedi who hired you for this job?,3,12,
JANGO FETT,OBI-WAN,370,Never heard of him.,1,4,
OBI-WAN,JANGO FETT,371,Really?,1,1,
JANGO FETT,OBI-WAN,372,I was recruited by a man called Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.,2,15,
OBI-WAN,JANGO FETT,373,Curious.,1,1,
JANGO FETT,OBI-WAN,374,Do you like your army?,1,5,
OBI-WAN,JANGO FETT,375,I look forward to seeing them in action.,2,8,
JANGO FETT,OBI-WAN,376,They'll do their job well. I'll guarantee that.,2,8,
OBI-WAN,JANGO FETT,377,"Thank you for your time, Jango.",2,6,
JANGO FETT,OBI-WAN,378,Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.,2,7,
BOBA FETT,JANGO FETT,379,"What is it, Dad?",1,4,
JANGO FETT,BOBA FETT,380,Pack your things. We're leaving.,2,5,
ANAKIN,PADME,381,"And when I got to them, we went into aggressive negotiations.",2,11,
ANAKIN,NA,382,Thank you.,1,2,
PADME,ANAKIN,383,Aggressive negotiations? What's that?,2,4,
ANAKIN,PADME,384,"Uh, well, negotiations with a lightsaber.",2,6,
PADME,ANAKIN,385,Oh.,1,1,
ANAKIN,PADME,386,"If Master Obi-Wan caught me doing this, he'd be very grumpy. From the moment I met you... all those years ago... not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm with you again... I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you-- I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me. My heart is beating... hoping that that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul... tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything that you ask. If you are suffering as much as I am, please, tell me.",26,119,
PADME,ANAKIN,387,I can't. We can't. It's...just not possible.,3,7,
ANAKIN,PADME,388,"Anything is possible, Padme. Listen to me.",2,7,
PADME,ANAKIN,389,"No, you listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi. I'm- I'm a senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion... it'll take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.",11,49,
ANAKIN,PADME,390,Then you do feel something.,1,5,
PADME,ANAKIN,391,I will not let you give up your future for me.,2,11,
ANAKIN,PADME,392,"You are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. Believe me, I wish that I could just wish away my feelings... but I can't.",7,30,
PADME,ANAKIN,393,I will not give in to this.,1,7,
ANAKIN,PADME,394,"Well, you know, it... wouldn't have to be that way. We could keep it a secret.",4,16,
PADME,ANAKIN,395,"We'd be living a lie... one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?",6,26,
ANAKIN,PADME,396,No. You're right. It would destroy us.,2,7,
TAUN WE,OBI-WAN,397,"Tell your council that the first battalions are ready. And remind them, if they need more troops... it will take more time to grow them.",6,25,
OBI-WAN,TAUN WE,398,"I won't forget, and thank you.",1,6,
TAUN WE,OBI-WAN,399,Thank you.,1,2,
OBI-WAN,R4,400,"R4! Scramble code five to Coruscant, care of the old folks' home!",3,12,
OBI-WAN,"YODA, MACE WINDU",401,I have successfully made contact with the prime minister of Kamino. They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army. I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter... is the assassin we are looking for.,8,41,
MACE WINDU,OBI-WAN,402,Do you think these cloners are involved in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?,3,14,
OBI-WAN,MACE WINDU,403,"No, Master. There appears to be no motive.",2,8,
YODA,OBI-WAN,404,"Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan. Clear your mind must be... if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.",5,21,
OBI-WAN,YODA,405,"Yes, Master.",1,2,
OBI-WAN,"YODA, MACE WINDU",406,They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed an order for a clone army... at the request of the senate almost ten years ago. I was under the impression he was killed before that. Did the council ever authorize the creation of a clone army?,8,42,
MACE WINDU,OBI-WAN,407,No. Whoever placed that order did not have the authorization of the Jedi Council.,3,14,
YODA,OBI-WAN,408,Bring him here. Question him we will.,2,7,
OBI-WAN,YODA,409,"Yes, Master. I will report back when I have him.",2,10,
YODA,MACE WINDU,410,Blind we are if creation of this clone army... we could not see.,3,13,
MACE WINDU,YODA,411,I think it is time we informed the senate... that our ability to use the Force has diminished.,4,18,
YODA,MACE WINDU,412,Only the dark lord of the Sith knows of our weakness. If informed the senate is... multiply our adversaries will.,4,20,
ANAKIN,ANAKIN,413,No. No.,2,2,
SHMI,NA,414,"Anakin, help me.",1,3,
ANAKIN,NA,415,"Mom, no.",1,2,
SHMI,NA,416,Anakin!,1,1,
ANAKIN,NA,417,Don't. No. No.,2,3,
ANAKIN,PADME,418,Don't go.,1,2,
PADME,ANAKIN,419,I don't want to disturb you.,1,6,
ANAKIN,PADME,420,Your presence is soothing.,1,4,
PADME,ANAKIN,421,You had another nightmare last night.,2,6,
ANAKIN,PADME,422,Jedi don't have nightmares.,1,4,
PADME,ANAKIN,423,I heard you.,1,3,
ANAKIN,PADME,424,"I saw my mother. She is suffering, Padme. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She is in pain. I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator... but I have to go. I have to help her.",9,42,
PADME,ANAKIN,425,I'll go with you.,1,4,
ANAKIN,PADME,426,I'm sorry. I don't have a choice.,2,7,
BOBA FETT,JANGO FETT,427,"Dad, look!",1,2,
JANGO FETT,BOBA FETT,428,"Boba, get on board!",1,4,
OBI-WAN,OBI-WAN,429,"Oh, not good.",1,3,

WATTO,ANAKIN,434,"What? What do you want? Wait! You're a Jedi! Whatever it is, I didn't do it.",3,16,
ANAKIN,WATTO,435,I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.,1,5,
WATTO,ANAKIN,436,"Ani? Little Ani? Nahhh. You are Ani! It is you! You sure sprouted, huh? A Jedi! What do ya know! Hey... maybe you could help with some deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.",9,35,
ANAKIN,WATTO,437,My mother.,1,2,
WATTO,ANAKIN,438,"Oh, yeah. Shmi. she's not mine no more. I sold her.",3,11,
ANAKIN,WATTO,439,You sold her?,1,3,
WATTO,ANAKIN,440,"Years ago. Sorry, Ani, but you know, business is business, huh? Yeah, I sold her to a moisture farmer named, uh, Lars. At least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her! Can ya beat that, eh? Yeah.",11,47,
ANAKIN,WATTO,441,Do you know where they are now?,2,7,
WATTO,ANAKIN,442,"Long way from here. Someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think.",4,15,
ANAKIN,WATTO,443,I'd like to know.,1,4,
WATTO,ANAKIN,444,Sure. Absolutely! Let's go look at my records?,3,8,

JANGO FETT,BOBA FETT,448,"He doesn't seem to take a hint, this guy.",2,9,
BOBA FETT,JANGO FETT,449,"Watch out! Get him, Dad! Get him! Fire!",2,8,
OBI-WAN,OBI-WAN,450,"Oh, blast! This is why I hate flying!",2,8,
BOBA FETT,JANGO FETT,451,We got him!,1,3,
JANGO FETT,BOBA FETT,452,We'll just have to finish him.,1,6,
OBI-WAN,R4,453,"R4, prepare to jettison the spare part canisters. Fire them now!",3,11,
JANGO FETT,BOBA FETT,454,"Well, we won't be seeing him again.",1,7,

THREEPIO,"OWEN LARS, ANAKIN, PADME",468,"Master Owen, might I present two most important visitors.",2,9,

OWEN LARS,ANAKIN,473,I guess I'm your stepbrother. I had a feeling you might show up someday.,4,14,
ANAKIN,OWEN LARS,474,Is my mother here?,1,4,
CLIEGG LARS,ANAKIN,475,"No, she's not. Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife. We should go inside. We have a lot to talk about.",5,20,
CLIEGG LARS,"ANAKIN, PADME",476,"It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere. A hunting party of Tusken Raiders. Your mother had gone out early, like she always did... to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators. From the tracks, she was about halfway home... when they took her. Those Tuskens walk like men... but they're vicious, mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. I'd be out there with them, but after I lost my leg... I just couldn't ride anymore until I heal. I don't want to give up on her... but she's been gone a month. There's little hope she's lasted this long.",25,109,
