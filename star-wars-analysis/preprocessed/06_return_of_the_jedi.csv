OBI-WAN,LUKE,249,Yoda will always be with you.,1,6,force
LUKE,OBI-WAN,250,Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.,2,15,force
OBI-WAN,LUKE,251,"You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.",1,47,force
LUKE,OBI-WAN,252,A certain point of view?,1,5,force
OBI-WAN,LUKE,253,"Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong.",2,75,force

OBI-WAN,LUKE,259,Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.,1,11,force
LUKE,OBI-WAN,260,Yoda spoke of another.,1,4,force
OBI-WAN,LUKE,261,The other he spoke of is your twin sister.,1,9,force
LUKE,OBI-WAN,262,But I have no sister.,1,5,force
OBI-WAN,LUKE,263,"Hmm. To protect you both from the emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.",1,48,force
LUKE,OBI-WAN,264,Leia! Leia's my sister.,1,4,force
OBI-WAN,LUKE,265,"Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the emperor.",1,24,force

HAN,LANDO,268,"Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.",1,27,
LANDO,HAN,269,I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.,1,9,
HAN,LANDO,270,"Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?",1,14,
MON MOTHMA,GROUP,271,"The emperor's made a critical error and the time for our attack has come. The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information.",4,99,
MON MOTHMA,ADMIRAL ACKBAR,272,"Admiral Ackbar, please.",1,3,
ADMIRAL ACKBAR,GROUP,273,"You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.",4,98,
HAN,LANDO,274,Good luck. You're gonna need it.,2,6,
ADMIRAL ACKBAR,GENERAL MADINE,275,General Madine.,1,2,
GENERAL MADINE,GROUP,276,"We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.",1,31,
THREEPIO,NA,277,Sounds dangerous.,1,2,
LEIA,HAN,278,I wonder who they found to pull that off.,1,9,
GENERAL MADINE,HAN,279,"General Solo, is your strike team assembled?",1,7,
HAN,GENERAL MADINE,280,"Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.",1,13,
HAN,CHEWIE,281,"Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.",1,13,
HAN,GENERAL MADINE,282,That's one.,1,2,

THREEPIO,R2D2,289,"""Exciting"" is hardly the word I would use.",1,8,
HAN,LANDO,290,Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.,1,27,
LANDO,HAN,291,"All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?",2,26,
HAN,LANDO,292,Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.,1,9,
LANDO,HAN,293,"Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck.",2,9,
HAN,LANDO,294,"You, too.",1,2,
HAN,LUKE,295,You got her warmed?,1,4,
LUKE,HAN,296,"Yeah, she's coming up.",1,4,
HAN,CHEWIE,297,"Yeah, well I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.",1,16,
LEIA,HAN,298,"Hey, you awake?",1,3,
HAN,LEIA,299,"Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.",1,14,
LEIA,HAN,300,"Come on, General, let's move.",1,5,
HAN,LEIA,301,Right.,1,1,
HAN,CHEWIE,302,Chewie...,1,1,
HAN,"LUKE, LEIA, CHEWIE",303,"... let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?",1,12,
LUKE,HAN,304,All set.,1,2,

HAN,"LEIA, CHEWIE, LUKE",306,"All right, hang on.",1,4,
VADER,PALPATINE,307,"What is thy bidding, my Master?",1,6,
PALPATINE,VADER,308,Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.,1,16,
VADER,PALPATINE,309,What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?,1,11,
PALPATINE,VADER,310,"It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us. Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.",1,36,

HAN,LEIA,318,It'll work. It'll work.,1,4,
LUKE,HAN,319,Vader's on that ship.,1,4,
HAN,LUKE,320,"Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships.",1,12,

HAN,CHEWIE,322,I don't know. Fly casual.,1,5,
VADER,PIETT,323,Where is that shuttle going?,1,5,
PIETT,HAN,324,"Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?",1,8,
HAN,PIETT,325,Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.,1,8,
VADER,PIETT,326,Do they have a code clearance?,1,6,
PIETT,VADER,327,"It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them.",1,15,
LUKE,HAN,328,I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.,1,8,
HAN,LUKE,329,"It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.",1,12,
PIETT,VADER,330,Shall I hold them?,1,4,
VADER,PIETT,331,No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.,1,11,
PIETT,VADER,332,"As you wish, my lord.",1,5,
PIETT,NA,333,Carry on.,1,2,
HAN,CHEWIE,334,"They're not goin' for it, Chewie.",1,6,

HAN,"LUKE, LEIA, CHEWIE",336,Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.,1,10,
THREEPIO,R2D2,337,"Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.",1,8,
LEIA,"HAN, LUKE",338,Should we try and go around?,1,6,
LUKE,LEIA,339,It'll take time.,1,3,
HAN,LUKE,340,This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.,1,10,
HAN,LUKE,341,Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.,1,11,

HAN,LUKE,351,Luke! Where's Leia?,1,3,
LUKE,HAN,352,What? She didn't come back?,1,5,
HAN,LUKE,353,I thought she was with you.,1,6,
LUKE,HAN,354,"We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her.",2,10,
HAN,NA,355,Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.,1,12,

THREEPIO,LUKE,357,"Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do.",1,9,
THREEPIO,R2D2,358,And you said it was pretty here.,1,7,
WICKET,LEIA,359,Eek,1,1,
LEIA,WICKET,360,Cut it out!,1,3,
LEIA,WICKET,361,I'm not gonna hurt you.,1,5,
LEIA,WICKET,362,"Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here is. Maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down. I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. All right. You want something to eat?",4,39,
LEIA,WICKET,363,That's right. Come on.,1,4,

PALPATINE,VADER,371,I told you to remain on the command ship.,1,9,
VADER,PALPATINE,372,A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.,1,12,
PALPATINE,VADER,373,"Yes, I know.",1,3,
VADER,PALPATINE,374,My son is with them.,1,5,
PALPATINE,VADER,375,Are you sure?,1,3,
VADER,PALPATINE,376,"I have felt him, my master.",1,6,
PALPATINE,VADER,377,"Strange that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.",1,17,
VADER,PALPATINE,378,"They are clear, my master.",1,5,
PALPATINE,VADER,379,Then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for them.,1,12,
VADER,PALPATINE,380,He will come to me?,1,5,
PALPATINE,VADER,381,"I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you, and then you will bring him before me.",1,25,
VADER,PALPATINE,382,As you wish.,1,3,
HAN,LUKE,383,Luke! Luke!,1,2,
THREEPIO,LUKE,384,"Oh, Master Luke.",1,3,
LUKE,HAN,385,There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.,1,11,
THREEPIO,LUKE,386,I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.,1,12,
HAN,LUKE,387,I hope she's all right.,1,5,
HAN,CHEWIE,388,"What, Chewie?",1,2,
HAN,CHEWIE,389,"What, Chewie?",1,2,
HAN,CHEWIE,390,"Hey, I don't get it.",1,5,
HAN,CHEWIE,391,"Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.",1,7,
LUKE,CHEWIE,392,"Chewie, wa-wait! Don't!",1,3,
HAN,CHEWIE,393,"Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.",1,10,
LUKE,HAN,394,"Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber?",1,23,
HAN,LUKE,395,"Yeah, sure.",1,2,
THREEPIO,R2D2,396,"Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long drop!",1,14,
R2D2,EWOKS,397,scared,1,2,
HAN,EWOK,398,What--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else. Hey!,2,8,
LUKE,HAN,399,"Han, don't. It'll be all right.",1,6,
LUKE,CHEWIE,400,"Chewie, give them your crossbow.",1,5,
THREEPIO,THREEPIO,401,"Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness.",1,6,
LUKE,THREEPIO,402,Do you understand anything they're saying?,1,6,
THREEPIO,LUKE,403,"Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication.",1,16,
HAN,THREEPIO,404,What are you telling them?,1,5,
THREEPIO,"HAN, LUKE",405,"Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.",1,25,
HAN,THREEPIO,406,"Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?",1,14,
THREEPIO,HAN,407,"I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.",1,12,
HAN,THREEPIO,408,Proper?,1,1,
THREEPIO,HAN,409,It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.,1,8,
HAN,THREEPIO,410,"Why, you--",1,2,
HAN,EWOKS,411,My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.,1,8,
HAN,NA,412,Hey!,1,1,
HAN,"LUKE, CHEWIE",413,I have a really bad feeling about this.,1,8,
HAN,THREEPIO,414,What did he say?,1,4,
THREEPIO,HAN,415,"I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.",1,21,
LUKE,LEIA,416,Leia!,1,1,
HAN,LEIA,417,Leia.,1,1,
LEIA,NA,418,Oh!,1,1,
THREEPIO,LEIA,419,Your Royal Highness.,1,3,
LEIA,EWOKS,420,But these are my friends.,1,5,
LEIA,THREEPIO,421,"Threepio, tell them they must be set free.",1,8,
HAN,LEIA,422,"Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.",1,11,
LUKE,THREEPIO,423,"Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.",1,17,
THREEPIO,LUKE,424,"But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly--",1,8,
LUKE,THREEPIO,425,Just tell them.,1,3,
THREEPIO,LUKE,426,"You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just... as I said they wouldn't.",1,14,
THREEPIO,THREEPIO,427,"Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!",2,6,
THREEPIO,"LUKE, R2D2",428,"Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!",2,20,

HAN,HAN,439,Just what I always wanted.,1,5,

WICKET,HAN,441,Ahh eecha womah,1,3,
HAN,WICKET,442,Thank you. Okay.,1,3,
THREEPIO,HAN,443,He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.,1,16,
HAN,THREEPIO,444,"Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.",2,30,
LEIA,LEIA,445,"Luke, what's wrong?",1,3,
LUKE,LEIA,446,"Leia, do you remember your mother? Your real mother?",1,9,
LEIA,LUKE,447,Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.,1,11,
LUKE,LEIA,448,What do you remember?,1,4,
LEIA,LUKE,449,"Just images, really. Feelings.",1,4,
LUKE,LEIA,450,Tell me.,1,2,
LEIA,LUKE,451,"She was very beautiful. Kind, but sad. Why are you asking me this?",2,13,
LUKE,LEIA,452,I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.,1,11,
LEIA,LUKE,453,"Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?",1,6,
LUKE,LEIA,454,"Vader is here. Now, on this moon.",1,7,
LEIA,LUKE,455,How do you know?,1,4,
LUKE,LEIA,456,"I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him.",4,38,
LEIA,LUKE,457,Why?,1,1,
LUKE,LEIA,458,He's my father.,1,3,
LEIA,LUKE,459,Your father?,1,2,
LUKE,LEIA,460,"There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.",1,27,
LEIA,LUKE,461,"Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.",1,16,
LUKE,LEIA,462,"You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time, you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it. And... my sister has it. Yes. It's you, Leia.",2,41,
LEIA,LUKE,463,I know. Somehow... I've always known.,1,6,
LUKE,LEIA,464,Then you know why I have to face him.,1,9,
LEIA,LUKE,465,"No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.",1,23,
LUKE,LEIA,466,"No, you don't. You've always been strong.",1,7,
LEIA,LUKE,467,"But, why must you confront him?",1,6,
LUKE,LEIA,468,Because... there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.,1,34,
HAN,LEIA,469,"Hey, what's goin' on?",1,4,
LEIA,HAN,470,Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.,1,12,
HAN,LEIA,471,"Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on?",1,8,
LEIA,HAN,472,I...I can't tell you.,1,4,

LEIA,HAN,476,Hold me.,1,2,
COMMANDER,VADER,477,"This is a rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this.",2,38,

COMMANDER,VADER,479,"Yes, my Lord.",1,3,
VADER,LUKE,480,The Emperor has been expecting you.,1,6,
LUKE,VADER,481,"I know, Father.",1,3,
VADER,LUKE,482,"So, you have accepted the truth.",1,6,
LUKE,VADER,483,"I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.",1,12,
VADER,LUKE,484,That name no longer has any meaning for me.,1,9,
LUKE,VADER,485,It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That was why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your emperor now.,1,43,
VADER,LUKE,486,"I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed you are powerful, as the emperor has foreseen.",2,21,
LUKE,VADER,487,Come with me.,1,3,
VADER,LUKE,488,Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.,2,20,
LUKE,VADER,489,"I will not turn, and you'll be forced to kill me.",1,11,
VADER,LUKE,490,If that is your destiny.,1,5,
LUKE,VADER,491,"Search your feelings, Father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.",1,19,
VADER,LUKE,492,"It is too late for me, son. The emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.",1,23,
LUKE,VADER,493,Then my father is truly dead.,1,6,
LEIA,"HAN, CHEWIE",494,The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.,1,20,
HAN,LEIA,495,"Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.",1,17,
LEIA,THREEPIO,496,What's he saying?,1,3,
THREEPIO,LEIA,497,He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.,1,13,
LANDO,ADMIRAL ACKBAR,498,"Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.",1,8,
ADMIRAL ACKBAR,NA,499,Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.,1,9,
LANDO,NIEN NUNB,500,"Don't worry, my friends down there. They'll have that shield down on time.",1,13,
LANDO,LANDO,501,Or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.,1,9,
ADMIRAL ACKBAR,GROUP,502,"All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.",1,10,
LANDO,ADMIRAL ACKBAR,503,All right. Stand by.,1,4,
HAN,EWOK,504,"Back door, huh? Good idea.",1,5,
HAN,LEIA,505,It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.,1,11,
LEIA,HAN,506,It only takes one to sound the alarm.,1,8,
HAN,LEIA,507,Then we'll do it real quiet like.,1,7,
THREEPIO,LEIA,508,"Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.",2,18,
LEIA,"THREEPIO, HAN, CHEWIE",509,"Oh, no.",1,2,
HAN,LEIA,510,There goes our surprise attack.,1,5,
SCOUT,NA,511,Look! Over there! Stop him!,1,5,
HAN,LEIA,512,Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left.,1,10,
HAN,THREEPIO,513,You stay here. We'll take care of this.,1,8,
THREEPIO,"HAN, LEIA",514,I have decided that we shall stay here.,1,8,
PALPATINE,LUKE,515,"Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those.",2,13,
PALPATINE,NA,516,"Guards, leave us.",1,3,
PALPATINE,LUKE,517,"I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time, you will call me master.",1,14,
LUKE,PALPATINE,518,You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.,1,12,
PALPATINE,LUKE,519,"Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken... about a great many things.",1,20,
VADER,PALPATINE,520,His lightsaber.,1,2,
PALPATINE,LUKE,521,"Ah, yes. A Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you.",1,30,
LUKE,PALPATINE,522,"You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead, and you with me.",1,10,
PALPATINE,LUKE,523,"Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes, I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.",2,23,
LUKE,PALPATINE,524,Your overconfidence is your weakness.,1,5,
PALPATINE,LUKE,525,Your faith in your friends is yours.,1,7,
VADER,LUKE,526,"It is pointless to resist, my son.",1,7,
PALPATINE,LUKE,527,Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends up there on the sanctuary moon are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet. It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them.,3,62,
