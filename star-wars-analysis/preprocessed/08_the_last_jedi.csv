POE,"FINN, ROSE",275,All right... You guys shut down that tracker. I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed. The question is... How do we sneak the two of you onto Snoke's destroyer?,1,30,
ROSE,"POE, FINN",276,We steal clearance codes.,1,4,
FINN,"ROSE, POE",277,"No, they are Bio-Hexaencripted and rescrambled every hour. We can't get through their security shields undetected. Nobody can.",1,18,

KYLO REN,REY,287,You'll bring Luke Skywalker to me. You're not doing this. The effort would kill you. Can you see my surroundings?,1,20,force
REY,KYLO REN,288,You are going to pay for what you did!,1,9,force
KYLO REN,REY,289,I can't see yours. Just you. So no. This is something else. Luke.,1,13,force
LUKE,REY,290,What's that about?,1,3,
REY,LUKE,291,I was cleaning my blaster. It went off.,1,8,
LUKE,REY,292,Let's get started.,1,3,
REY,LUKE,293,Who were those things?,1,4,
LUKE,REY,294,Caretakers. Island natives. They've kept up the Jedi structures since they were built.,1,13,
REY,LUKE,295,I don't think they like me.,1,6,
LUKE,REY,296,Can't imagine why.,1,3,
REY,LUKE,297,"Master Skywalker, we need you to bring the Jedi back because Kylo Ren is strong with the dark side of the Force. Without the Jedi, we won't stand a chance against him.",1,32,
LUKE,REY,298,What do you know about the Force?,1,7,
REY,LUKE,299,It's a power that Jedi have that lets them control people and make things float.,1,15,
LUKE,REY,300,"Impressive. Every word in that sentence was wrong. Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed. The Force is not a power you have. It's not about lifting rocks. It's the energy between all things, a tension, a balance that binds the universe together.",1,42,
REY,LUKE,301,OK. But what is it?,1,5,
LUKE,REY,302,"Close your eyes. Breathe. Now, reach out.",1,7,
REY,LUKE,303,I feel something.,1,3,
LUKE,REY,304,You feel it?,1,3,
REY,LUKE,305,"Yes, I feel it.",1,4,
LUKE,REY,306,That's the Force.,1,3,
REY,LUKE,307,Really?,1,1,
LUKE,REY,308,"Wow, it must be really strong with you.",1,8,
REY,LUKE,309,I've never felt anythi----! Ow! You meant reach out like... I'll try again.,1,13,
LUKE,REY,310,Breathe. Just breathe. Reach out with your feelings. What do you see?,1,12,
REY,LUKE,311,"The island. Life. Death and decay, that feeds new life. Warmth. Cold. Peace. Violence.",1,14,
LUKE,REY,312,And between it all?,1,4,
REY,LUKE,313,Balance. An energy. A Force.,1,5,
LUKE,REY,314,And inside you?,1,3,
REY,LUKE,315,"Inside me, that same Force.",1,5,
LUKE,REY,316,"And this is the lesson. That Force does not belong to the Jedi. To say that if the Jedi die, the light dies, is vanity. Can you feel that?",1,29,
REY,LUKE,317,There's something else beneath the island. A place. A dark place.,1,11,
LUKE,REY,318,"Balance. Powerful light, powerful darkness.",1,5,
REY,LUKE,319,It's cold. It's calling me.,1,5,
LUKE,REY,320,"Resist it, Rey. Rey? Rey! You went straight to the dark.",1,11,
REY,LUKE,321,That place was trying to show me something.,1,8,
LUKE,REY,322,It offered you something you needed. And you didn't even try to stop yourself.,1,14,
REY,LUKE,323,But I didn't see you. Nothing from you. You've closed yourself off from the Force. Of course you have.,1,19,
LUKE,REY,324,I've seen this raw strength only once before in Ben Solo. It didn't scare me enough then. It does now.,1,20,
AMILYN HOLDO,KAYDEL KO CONNIX,325,What was that?,1,3,
KAYDEL KO CONNIX,AMILYN HOLDO,326,"Nothing, Admiral. Passing debris.",1,4,
FINN,ROSE,327,The fleet's only got 18 hours of fuel left. We gotta hurry.,1,12,
REY,CHEWIE,328,Still can't reach the Resistance?,1,5,
REY,CHEWIE,329,"Keep at it. If you get through, check their status. And ask about Finn.",1,14,
KYLO REN,REY,330,Why is the Force connecting us? You and I.,1,9,force
REY,KYLO REN,331,Murderous snake. You're too late. You lost. I found Skywalker.,1,10,force
KYLO REN,REY,332,"Did he tell you what happened? The night I destroyed his temple, did he tell you why?",1,17,force
REY,KYLO REN,333,I know everything I need to know about you.,1,9,force
KYLO REN,REY,334,"You do? Ah, you do. You have that look in your eyes. From the forest. When you called me a monster.",1,21,force
REY,KYLO REN,335,You are a monster.,1,4,force
KYLO REN,REY,336,"Yes, I am.",1,3,force

FINN,ROSE,352,"Look, this whole place is beautiful. I mean, come on. Why do you hate it so much?",1,17,
ROSE,FINN,353,Look closer. My sister and I grew up in a poor mining system. The First Order stripped our ore to finance their military then shelled us to test their weapons. They took everything we had. And who do you think these people are? There's only one business in the galaxy that'll get you this rich.,1,55,

LUKE,REY,364,"Lesson Two. Now that they're extinct, the Jedi are romanticized, deified. But if you strip away the myth and look at their deeds, the legacy of the Jedi is failure. Hypocrisy, hubris.",1,32,
REY,LUKE,365,That's not true.,1,3,
LUKE,REY,366,"At the height of their powers, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise, create the Empire and wipe them out. It was a Jedi Master who was responsible for the training and creation of Darth Vader.",1,35,

LUKE,REY,368,"And I became a legend. For many years, there was balance and then I saw Ben. My nephew with that mighty Skywalker blood. And in my hubris, I thought I could train him, I could pass on my strengths. Han was Han about it. Leia trusted me with her son. I took him, and a dozen students and began a training temple. By the time I realized I was no match for the darkness rising in him, it was too late.",1,81,
REY,LUKE,369,What happened?,1,2,
LUKE,REY,370,"I went to confront him. And he turned on me. He must have thought I was dead. When I came to, the temple was burning. He had vanished with a handful of my students. And slaughtered the rest. Leia blamed Snoke, but it was me. I failed. Because I was Luke Skywalker. Jedi master. A legend.",1,56,
