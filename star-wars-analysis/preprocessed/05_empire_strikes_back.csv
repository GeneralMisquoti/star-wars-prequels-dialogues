HAN,LUKE,1,"Loud and clear, kid. What's up?",1,6,
LUKE,HAN,2,"Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.",2,12,
HAN,LUKE,3,"There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. Sensors are placed, I'm going back.",4,19,
LUKE,HAN,4,Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long.,4,24,
LUKE,NA,5,"Steady! Hey, steady girl. Hey, what's the matter? You smell something?",2,11,

RIEEKAN,HAN,11,Commander Skywalker reported in yet?,1,5,
HAN,RIEEKAN,12,No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.,2,10,
RIEEKAN,HAN,13,"With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.",3,17,
HAN,RIEEKAN,14,"General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore.",2,9,
RIEEKAN,HAN,15,I'm sorry to hear that.,1,5,
HAN,RIEEKAN,16,"Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.",3,19,
RIEEKAN,HAN,17,"A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you.",3,20,

HAN,LEIA,27,We need?,1,2,
LEIA,HAN,28,Yes.,1,1,
HAN,LEIA,29,"Well, what about you need?",1,5,
LEIA,HAN,30,I need? I don't know what you're talking about.,2,9,
HAN,LEIA,31,You probably don't.,1,3,
LEIA,HAN,32,And what precisely am I supposed to know?,2,8,
HAN,LEIA,33,Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.,3,15,
LEIA,HAN,34,Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...,2,11,
HAN,LEIA,35,No! That's not it. Come on. Come on.,2,8,
LEIA,HAN,36,You're imagining things.,1,3,
HAN,LEIA,37,Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?,3,20,
LEIA,HAN,38,I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.,1,7,
HAN,LEIA,39,I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!,2,10,
THREEPIO,R2D2,40,Don't try to blame me. I didn't,1,7,
THREEPIO,R2D2,41,ask you to turn on the thermal,1,7,
THREEPIO,R2D2,42,heater. I merely commented that it,1,6,
THREEPIO,R2D2,43,was freezing in the princess' chamber.,2,6,
THREEPIO,R2D2,44,But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.,3,20,
THREEPIO,R2D2,45,"Oh, switch off.",1,3,
HAN,CHEWIE,46,Why did you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these.,3,21,
THREEPIO,HAN,47,"Excuse me, sir.",1,3,
HAN,CHEWIE,48,Put them back together right now.,1,6,
THREEPIO,HAN,49,"Might I have a word with you, please?",2,8,
HAN,THREEPIO,50,What do you want?,1,4,
THREEPIO,HAN,51,"Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator.",3,14,
HAN,THREEPIO,52,I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.,2,11,
THREEPIO,HAN,53,"Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is.",4,19,
HAN,THREEPIO,54,I don't know where he is.,1,6,
THREEPIO,HAN,55,Nobody knows where he is.,1,5,

DECK OFFICER,HAN,60,"Yes, sir?",1,2,
HAN,DECK OFFICER,61,Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?,2,7,
DECK OFFICER,HAN,62,I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance.,2,13,
HAN,DECK OFFICER,63,It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there.,2,13,
DECK OFFICER,HAN,64,"Yes, sir.",1,2,
THREEPIO,HAN,65,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?",2,9,
HAN,THREEPIO,66,Why not?,1,2,
THREEPIO,R2D2,67,"Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.",4,19,
DECK OFFICER,HAN,68,"Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in.",3,17,
HAN,DECK OFFICER,69,Not likely. Are the speeders ready?,1,6,
DECK OFFICER,HAN,70,Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold.,2,11,
HAN,DECK OFFICER,71,We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.,2,7,
DECK OFFICER,HAN,72,"Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly.",2,6,
HAN,DECK OFFICER,73,That's right. And my friends out in it.,2,8,
ASSISTANT OFFICER,NA,74,I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set screen alpha.,2,9,
DECK OFFICER,HAN,75,Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker.,2,9,
HAN,DECK OFFICER,76,Then I'll see you in hell!,1,6,
WAMPA,NA,77,GRAAAAAH,1,1,
THREEPIO,R2D2,78,"You must come along now, Artoo.",1,6,
THREEPIO,R2D2,79,There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up.,2,13,
THREEPIO,R2D2,80,Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again.,2,12,
THREEPIO,R2D2,81,"And he'll be quite all right, you'll see.",1,8,
THREEPIO,R2D2,82,Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right.,2,8,
LIEUTENANT,NA,83,"Sir, all the patrols are in. still no- still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.",3,15,
THREEPIO,LEIA,84,"Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.",5,29,
DERLIN,LEIA,85,"Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed. Close the doors.",4,18,
LIEUTENANT,LEIA,86,"Yes, sir.",1,2,
THREEPIO,LEIA,87,Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five... to one.,3,12,
THREEPIO,LEIA,88,"Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes... from time to time. Dear oh dear.",3,15,
THREEPIO,LEIA,89,Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll,1,8,
THREEPIO,LEIA,90,"be all right. He's quite clever, you know... for a human being.",2,12,

LUKE,NA,99,Ben... Ben...,1,2,
HAN,LUKE,100,"Hang on, kid.",1,3,

LUKE,NA,103,Yoda...,1,1,
HAN,LUKE,104,...but it will keep you warm... til I get the shelter up.,2,12,
LUKE,NA,105,Ben. Ben. Dagobah.,1,3,
HAN,LUKE,106,I thought they smelled bad on the outside!,2,8,
ZEV,NA,107,"Echo Base... I've got something. Not much, but it could be a life form. Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rogue Two. this is Rogue Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rogue Two.",7,41,
HAN,ZEV,108,Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by.,2,9,
ZEV,NA,109,"Echo Base... this is Rogue Two. I've found them. Repeat, I've found them.",2,13,
THREEPIO,LUKE,110,"Master Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again.",2,12,
LUKE,THREEPIO,111,"Thanks, 3PO",1,2,
THREEPIO,LUKE,112,"Artoo expresses his relief, also.",1,5,
HAN,HAN,113,"How are you feeling, kid? You",1,6,
HAN,LUKE,114,don't look so bad to me. In,1,7,
HAN,LUKE,115,"fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.",2,12,
LUKE,HAN,116,Thanks to you.,1,3,
HAN,LUKE,117,"That's two you owe me, junior.",1,6,
HAN,LEIA,118,"Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.",3,16,
LEIA,HAN,119,I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy field.,4,25,
HAN,LEIA,120,That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.,3,21,
LEIA,HAN,121,"I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain.",2,10,
HAN,CHEWIE,122,"Laugh it up, fuzzball.",1,4,
HAN,CHEWIE,123,But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me.,4,17,
LEIA,HAN,124,"My...! Why, you stuck up,... half- witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf-herder!",2,9,
HAN,LEIA,125,Who's scruffy-looking?,1,2,
HAN,LUKE,126,"I must have hit pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?",3,19,
LEIA,HAN,127,"Well, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?",2,10,
ANNOUNCER,NA,128,"Headquarters personnel, report to command center.",2,6,
HAN,LUKE,129,Take it easy.,1,3,
THREEPIO,LUKE,130,"Excuse us, please.",1,3,
RIEEKAN,LEIA,131,"Princess... we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east.",4,17,
SENIOR CONTROLLER,NA,132,It's metal.,1,2,
LEIA,NA,133,Then it couldn't be one of those creatures.,2,8,
HAN,NA,134,"It could be a speeder, one of ours.",1,8,
SENIOR CONTROLLER,NA,135,No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through.,2,9,
THREEPIO,NA,136,"Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.",4,24,
HAN,NA,137,"It isn't friendly, whatever it is.",1,6,
HAN,CHEWIE,138,"Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.",1,7,
HAN,LEIA,139,Afraid there's not much left.,1,5,
LEIA,HAN,140,What was it?,1,3,
HAN,LEIA,141,Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct.,3,16,
LEIA,HAN,142,An Imperial probe droid.,1,4,
HAN,"LEIA, RIEEKAN",143,It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.,2,9,
RIEEKAN,NA,144,We'd better start the evacuation.,1,5,
PIETT,OZZEL,145,Admiral.,1,1,
OZZEL,PIETT,146,"Yes, Captain",1,2,
PIETT,OZZEL,147,"I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had.",4,27,
OZZEL,PIETT,148,"We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads!",3,14,
PIETT,OZZEL,149,The visuals indicate life readings.,1,5,
OZZEL,PIETT,150,It could mean anything. If we followed up every lead...,2,10,
PIETT,OZZEL,151,"But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms.",2,13,
VADER,PIETT,152,You found something?,1,3,
PIETT,VADER,153,"Yes, my lord.",1,3,
VADER,"PIETT, OZZEL",154,That's it. The Rebels are there.,1,6,
OZZEL,VADER,155,"My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be...",3,15,
VADER,OZZEL,156,That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system.,3,18,

MEDICAL DROID,LUKE,163,"Sir, it will take quite a while to evacuate the T-forty-sevens.",2,11,
LUKE,MEDICAL DROID,164,"Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports.",3,17,
MEDICAL DROID,LUKE,165,"Take care, sir.",1,3,
LUKE,MEDICAL DROID,166,Thanks.,1,1,
LUKE,CHEWIE,167,Chewie?,1,1,
LUKE,CHEWIE,168,"Take care of yourself, okay?",1,5,
HAN,LUKE,169,"Hi, kid.",1,2,
HAN,NA,170,There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end.,2,14,
HAN,LUKE,171,Wait a second. You all right?,2,6,
LUKE,HAN,172,Yeah.,1,1,
HAN,LUKE,173,Be careful.,1,2,

VADER,VEERS,177,"What is it, General?",1,4,
VEERS,VADER,178,"My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area of the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.",7,35,
VADER,VEERS,179,The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system.,4,18,
VEERS,VADER,180,He felt surprise was wiser...,1,5,

IMPERIAL OFFICER,NA,302,Take evasive action!,1,3,
HAN,CHEWIE,303,Prepare to make the jump to light- speed.,2,8,
THREEPIO,HAN,304,"But, sir!",1,2,
LEIA,HAN,305,They're getting closer!,1,3,
HAN,LEIA,306,Oh yeah? Watch this.,1,4,
LEIA,HAN,307,Watch what?,1,2,
HAN,LEIA,308,I think we're in trouble.,1,5,
THREEPIO,HAN,309,"If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!",4,22,

HAN,CHEWIE,311,Horizontal boosters...!,1,2,

HAN,LEIA,328,"You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart.",3,18,
LEIA,HAN,329,I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.,3,16,

THREEPIO,"LEIA, HAN",331,Pulverized?,1,1,
HAN,"LEIA, THREEPIO, CHEWIE",332,I'm going in closer to one of those big ones.,2,10,

THREEPIO,HAN,335,"Oh, this is suicide! There's nowhere to go!",1,8,
HAN,"LEIA, CHEWIE, THREEPIO",336,There. That looks pretty good.,1,5,
LEIA,HAN,337,What looks pretty good?,1,4,

LUKE,R2D2,347,Artoo? Artoo? Artoo! Where are you? Artoo!,2,7,
LUKE,R2D2,348,You be more careful.,1,4,

HAN,"CHEWIE, LEIA, THREEPIO",361,I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.,2,11,
THREEPIO,HAN,362,"Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but... does that include shutting me down, too?",3,14,
HAN,THREEPIO,363,"No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.",3,16,
THREEPIO,HAN,364,"Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.",2,10,
HAN,THREEPIO,365,Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.,2,12,

LEIA,HAN,370,"Let go, please.",1,3,
HAN,LEIA,371,Don't get excited.,1,3,
LEIA,HAN,372,"Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.",2,12,
HAN,LEIA,373,"Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.",2,9,
LUKE,R2D2,374,What? Ready for some power?,1,5,
LUKE,R2D2,375,Okay. Let's see now. Put that in,1,7,
LUKE,R2D2,376,there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda... if he even exists.,3,18,
LUKE,R2D2,377,It's a really strange place to find a Jedi master.,1,10,
LUKE,R2D2,378,This place gives me the creeps.,1,6,
LUKE,R2D2,379,Still... there's something familiar about this place.,2,7,
LUKE,R2D2,380,I don't know...I feel like...,1,5,
YODA,LUKE,381,Feel like what?,1,3,
LUKE,"YODA, R2D2",382,Like we're being watched!,1,4,
YODA,LUKE,383,"Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here?",3,16,
LUKE,YODA,384,I'm looking for someone.,1,4,
YODA,LUKE,385,"Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say?",2,8,
LUKE,YODA,386,Right.,1,1,
YODA,LUKE,387,Help you I can. Yes.,1,5,
LUKE,YODA,388,I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.,2,10,
YODA,LUKE,389,"Oh, a great warrior. Wars not make one great.",2,9,
LUKE,YODA,390,Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner!,2,7,
YODA,LUKE,391,"How you get so big, eating food of this kind?",2,10,
LUKE,YODA,392,"Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just...",4,28,
YODA,LUKE,393,"Awww, cannot get your ship out?",1,6,
LUKE,YODA,394,"Hey, get out of there! Hey, you could have broken this.",2,11,
YODA,LUKE,395,"No, aw.",1,2,
LUKE,YODA,396,Don't do that.,1,3,
LUKE,YODA,397,...you're making a mess. Hey!,1,5,
YODA,LUKE,398,Mine! Or I will help you not.,1,7,
LUKE,YODA,399,I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'm going to need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.,3,22,
YODA,LUKE,400,Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.,1,6,
LUKE,R2D2,401,"Artoo, let him have it!",1,5,
YODA,R2D2,402,Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!,1,4,
LUKE,R2D2,403,Artoo!,1,1,
LUKE,YODA,404,"Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do.",3,15,
YODA,LUKE,405,"No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. Find your friend.",3,12,
LUKE,YODA,406,I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.,2,12,
YODA,LUKE,407,Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.,2,7,
LUKE,YODA,408,You know him?,1,3,
YODA,LUKE,409,"Take you to him, I will. Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come.",3,17,
YODA,LUKE,410,"Come, come.",1,2,
LUKE,R2D2,411,Artoo?,1,1,
LUKE,R2D2,412,Stay here and watch after the camp.,2,7,
THREEPIO,THREEPIO,413,Where is Artoo when I need him?,2,7,
THREEPIO,HAN,414,"Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.",7,40,
HAN,THREEPIO,415,"Well, of course I'll have to replace it.",2,8,
HAN,CHEWIE,416,"Here, Chewie...",1,2,
HAN,CHEWIE,417,... I think we'd better replace,1,6,
HAN,CHEWIE,418,the negative power coupling.,1,4,
HAN,LEIA,419,"Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.",2,8,
LEIA,HAN,420,Would you please stop calling me that?,2,7,
HAN,LEIA,421,"Sure, Leia.",1,2,
LEIA,HAN,422,You make it so difficult sometimes.,2,6,
HAN,LEIA,423,"I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.",4,22,
LEIA,HAN,424,"Occasionally, maybe... ... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.",3,10,
HAN,LEIA,425,Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.,2,8,
LEIA,HAN,426,Stop that.,1,2,
HAN,LEIA,427,Stop what?,1,2,
LEIA,HAN,428,Stop that! My hands are dirty.,1,6,
HAN,LEIA,429,"My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?",2,10,
LEIA,HAN,430,Afraid?,1,1,
HAN,LEIA,431,You're trembling.,1,2,
LEIA,HAN,432,I'm not trembling.,1,3,
HAN,LEIA,433,You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.,3,14,
LEIA,HAN,434,I happen to like nice men.,1,6,
HAN,LEIA,435,I'm a nice man.,1,4,
LEIA,HAN,436,"No, you're not. You're -",1,5,
THREEPIO,HAN,437,"Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.",2,9,
HAN,THREEPIO,438,Thank you. Thank you very much.,1,6,
THREEPIO,HAN,439,"Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.",1,5,
NEEDA,VADER,440,"... and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed.",5,28,
VADER,NEEDA,441,"No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found.",4,18,
PIETT,VADER,442,Lord Vader.,1,2,
VADER,PIETT,443,"Yes, Admiral, what is it?",1,5,
PIETT,VADER,444,The Emperor commands you make contact with him.,2,8,
VADER,PIETT,445,Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission.,3,16,
PIETT,VADER,446,"Yes, my lord.",1,3,
VADER,PALPATINE,447,"What is thy bidding, my master?",1,6,
PALPATINE,VADER,448,There is a great disturbance in the Force.,2,8,
VADER,PALPATINE,449,I have felt it.,1,4,
PALPATINE,VADER,450,We have a new enemy. The young rebel who destoyed the Death Star. I have no doubt that this boy is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.,2,26,
VADER,PALPATINE,451,How is that possible?,1,4,
PALPATINE,VADER,452,"Search your feelings, Lord Vader. You will know it to be true. He could destroy us.",1,16,
VADER,PALPATINE,453,He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.,2,10,
PALPATINE,VADER,454,The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.,3,15,
VADER,PALPATINE,455,"If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.",2,11,
PALPATINE,VADER,456,Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?,2,11,
VADER,PALPATINE,457,"He will join us or die, master.",2,7,
LUKE,YODA,458,"Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now.",3,15,
YODA,LUKE,459,"Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food? Good?",3,17,
LUKE,YODA,460,How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?,2,13,
YODA,LUKE,461,"Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. Root leaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi?",4,21,
LUKE,YODA,462,"Mostly because of my father, I guess.",2,7,
YODA,LUKE,463,"Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.",2,9,
LUKE,YODA,464,"Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. I don't know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time.",5,27,
YODA,OBI-WAN,465,I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.,2,9,force
OBI-WAN,YODA,466,He will learn patience.,1,4,force
YODA,OBI-WAN,467,"Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.",1,8,force
OBI-WAN,YODA,468,Was I any different when you taught me?,2,8,force
YODA,OBI-WAN,469,No. He is not ready.,1,5,force
LUKE,YODA,470,Yoda! I am ready. I...,1,5,
LUKE,OBI-WAN,471,"Ben! I - I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm -",1,13,force
YODA,LUKE,472,"Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For 800 years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. What he was doing. Adventure. Excitement. A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!",14,81,
OBI-WAN,YODA,473,"So was I, if you'll remember.",1,6,force
YODA,OBI-WAN,474,"He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.",2,11,force
LUKE,YODA,475,But I've learned so much.,1,5,
YODA,OBI-WAN,476,Will he finish what he begins?,1,6,force
LUKE,YODA,477,I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.,1,8,
YODA,LUKE,478,Oh. You will be. You will be.,1,7,
THREEPIO,HAN,479,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion...",1,7,
HAN,THREEPIO,480,"I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.",2,8,
LEIA,HAN,481,There's something out there.,1,4,
HAN,LEIA,482,Where?,1,1,
LEIA,HAN,483,"Outside, in the cave.",1,4,
THREEPIO,HAN,484,There it is. Listen! Listen!,1,5,
HAN,"THREEPIO, LEIA, CHEWIE",485,I'm going out there.,1,4,
LEIA,HAN,486,Are you crazy?!,1,3,
HAN,LEIA,487,I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart.,3,16,
LEIA,HAN,488,Then I'm going with you.,1,5,
THREEPIO,NA,489,"I think it might be better if I stay behind and guard the ship. Oh, no.",3,16,
LEIA,"HAN, CHEWIE",490,This ground sure feels strange.,1,5,
LEIA,"HAN, CHEWIE",491,It doesn't feel like rock.,1,5,
HAN,LEIA,492,There's an awful lot of moisture in here.,2,8,
LEIA,HAN,493,I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.,2,10,
HAN,LEIA,494,Yeah. Watch out!,2,3,
HAN,"LEIA, CHEWIE",495,"It's all right, It's all right. Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock.",1,12,
HAN,CHEWIE,496,"Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there are no more attached.",3,14,

LEIA,HAN,498,Mynocks.,1,1,
HAN,LEIA,499,Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.,2,12,
LEIA,HAN,500,Han!,1,1,
THREEPIO,MYNOCK,501,Aghh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!,2,9,
HAN,HAN,502,Wait a minute...,1,3,
HAN,CHEWIE,503,"All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!",2,8,
LEIA,HAN,504,The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...,2,12,
HAN,LEIA,505,No time to discuss this in committee.,2,7,
LEIA,HAN,506,I am not a committee!,1,5,
LEIA,HAN,507,You can't make the jump to light- speed in this asteroid field...,2,12,

THREEPIO,HAN,509,Look!,1,1,
HAN,THREEPIO,510,"I see it, I see it.",1,6,
THREEPIO,"HAN, LEIA, CHEWIE",511,We're doomed!,1,2,
LEIA,HAN,512,The cave is collapsing.,1,4,
HAN,LEIA,513,This is no cave.,1,4,
LEIA,HAN,514,What?,1,1,
YODA,LUKE,515,"Yes, run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger... fear... aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.",11,60,
LUKE,YODA,516,Vader. Is the dark side stronger?,1,6,
YODA,LUKE,517,"No, no. No. Quicker, easier, more seductive.",2,7,
LUKE,YODA,518,But how am I to know the good side from the bad?,2,12,
YODA,LUKE,519,"You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.",4,22,
LUKE,YODA,520,But tell me why I can't...,1,6,
YODA,LUKE,521,"No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions.",3,18,
LUKE,YODA,522,"There's something not right. I feel cold, death.",2,8,
YODA,LUKE,523,That place is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.,3,21,

HAN,CHEWIE,579,up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.,2,13,
THREEPIO,HAN,580,I really don't see how that is going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...,5,25,
HAN,LEIA,581,Thank you.,1,2,
LEIA,HAN,582,What did you have in mind for your next move?,2,10,
HAN,LEIA,583,"Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.",5,21,
LEIA,HAN,584,With the rest of the garbage. Then what?,2,8,
HAN,LEIA,585,Then we got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas?,3,14,

LEIA,HAN,691,The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.,5,25,
HAN,LEIA,692,Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.,2,12,
LEIA,HAN,693,I don't trust Lando.,1,4,
HAN,LEIA,694,"Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone.",3,16,

LEIA,CHEWIE,696,What happened?,1,2,
HAN,CHEWIE,697,Where?,1,1,
HAN,CHEWIE,698,Found him in a junk pile?,1,6,
LEIA,CHEWIE,699,"Oh, what a mess. Chewie, you",1,6,
LEIA,CHEWIE,700,think you can repair him?,1,5,
HAN,LEIA,701,Lando's got people that can fix him.,2,7,

LANDO,"LEIA, HAN",709,Having trouble with your droid?,1,5,
HAN,LANDO,710,No. No problem. Why?,1,4,
LANDO,"LEIA, HAN, CHEWIE",711,"So you see, since we're a small",1,7,
LANDO,"LEIA, HAN, CHEWIE",712,"operation, we don't fall into the...jurisdiction of the Empire.",3,11,
LEIA,LANDO,713,So you're part of the mining guild then?,2,8,
LANDO,LEIA,714,"No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed... which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.",6,28,
HAN,LANDO,715,Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?,3,17,
LANDO,"HAN, LEIA, CHEWIE",716,That's always been a danger that looms like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will ensure security.,4,23,
LANDO,"HAN, LEIA, CHEWIE",717,I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.,2,14,
VADER,"LEIA, CHEWIE, HAN",718,We would be honored if you would join us.,2,9,
LANDO,HAN,719,I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.,2,12,

VADER,BOBA FETT,727,You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker.,3,13,

VADER,BOBA FETT,729,He will not be permanently damaged.,1,6,
LANDO,VADER,730,"Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?",2,8,
VADER,LANDO,731,They must never again leave this city.,2,7,
LANDO,VADER,732,"That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!",3,16,
VADER,LANDO,733,Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.,2,7,
LANDO,VADER,734,No.,1,1,
VADER,LANDO,735,Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here.,2,13,
LANDO,LANDO,736,This deal is getting worse all the time.,2,8,
THREEPIO,CHEWIE,737,"Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right",2,12,
THREEPIO,CHEWIE,738,because now I can't see.,1,5,

THREEPIO,CHEWIE,741,Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...,2,10,
HAN,CHEWIE,742,I feel terrible.,1,3,
LEIA,HAN,743,Why are they doing this?,1,5,
HAN,LEIA,744,They never even asked me any questions.,2,7,
LEIA,HAN,745,Lando.,1,1,
HAN,LANDO,746,"Get out of here, Lando!",1,5,
LANDO,HAN,747,Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.,3,15,

LANDO,HAN,749,"They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.",2,11,
LEIA,LANDO,750,What about Han?,1,3,
LANDO,LEIA,751,Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.,2,7,
LEIA,LANDO,752,Vader wants us all dead.,1,5,
LANDO,LEIA,753,He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.,2,11,
HAN,LANDO,754,Luke.,1,1,
LANDO,"HAN, LEIA",755,Lord Vader's set a trap for him.,1,7,
LEIA,LANDO,756,And we're the bait.,1,4,
LANDO,"LEIA, HAN",757,"Well, he's on his way.",1,5,
HAN,LANDO,758,"Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? My friend!",3,11,
LANDO,NA,759,Stop!,1,1,
LANDO,HAN,760,"I've done all I can. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems.",2,17,
HAN,LANDO,761,"Yeah, you're a real hero.",1,5,
LEIA,HAN,762,You certainly have a way with people.,2,7,
VADER,LANDO,763,"This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the emperor.",4,18,
IMPERIAL SOLDIER,VADER,764,"Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class.",2,6,
VADER,IMPERIAL SOLDIER,765,Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.,2,8,
LANDO,VADER,766,"Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him.",4,20,
VADER,LANDO,767,I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it... on Captain Solo.,3,15,
THREEPIO,CHEWIE,768,"If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility for me, so don't do anything foolish.",5,28,

VADER,BOBA FETT,772,The Empire will compensate you if he dies.,2,8,

HAN,CHEWIE,778,"Hey! Hey! Listen to me. Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!",2,12,
HAN,CHEWIE,779,"Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. Do You hear me, huh?",4,22,
LEIA,HAN,780,I love you!,1,3,
HAN,LEIA,781,I know.,1,2,
THREEPIO,CHEWIE,782,"What... what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see.",2,10,
THREEPIO,"CHEWIE, LEIA",783,"Oh, they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is.",4,20,
VADER,LANDO,784,"Well, Calrissian, did he survive?",1,5,
LANDO,VADER,785,"Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation.",2,7,

VADER,LANDO,790,"Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.",3,10,
LANDO,VADER,791,You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.,2,11,
VADER,LANDO,792,I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.,2,12,
LEIA,LUKE,793,"Luke! Luke, don't - it's a trap! It's a trap!",2,10,
VADER,LUKE,794,"The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet.",3,14,
LANDO,LOBOT,795,Well done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move.,3,14,
LEIA,LANDO,796,What do you think you're doing?,1,6,
LANDO,LEIA,797,We're getting out of here.,1,5,
THREEPIO,THREEPIO,798,I knew all along it had to be a mistake.,2,10,
LEIA,LANDO,799,Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you?,3,15,
LANDO,CHEWIE,800,I had no choice...,1,4,
THREEPIO,CHEWIE,801,"What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!",2,8,

LANDO,"LEIA, CHEWIE",828,This way.,1,2,
