FINN,HAN,309,"Wait- what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey! You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you?",4,17,
HAN,"FINN, REY",310,I'm hauling Rathtars. Oh great. It's the Guavian Death Gang- they must've tracked us from Nantoon.,3,16,
REY,"FINN, HAN",311,What's a Rathtar?,1,3,

HAN,"FINN, REY",321,"He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way.",3,23,
FINN,HAN,322,What about the Rathtars... where are you keeping them?,2,9,

FINN,REY,335,A lot of them.,1,4,
BALA-TIK,HAN,336,The question is how much longer will we know each other? Not long. We want our money back now.,3,19,

BALA-TIK,"HAN, BB8",351,And two fugitives.,1,3,
HAN,BALA-TIK,352,First I've heard of it.,1,5,
RAZOO QIN-FEE,BALA-TIK,353,Search the freighter.,1,3,
REY,FINN,354,"Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs!",3,18,
FINN,REY,355,Close the blast doors from here?,1,6,

SNOKE,ARMITAGE HUX,397,General! Our strategy must now change.,2,6,
ARMITAGE HUX,SNOKE,398,"The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker.",8,45,

HAN,"REY, FINN",430,"This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him.",3,18,
REY,HAN,431,Why did he leave?,1,4,
HAN,"REY, FINN",432,"He was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible... He just walked away from everything.",5,27,
FINN,HAN,433,Do you know what happened to him?,1,7,
HAN,"REY, FINN",434,There're a lot of rumors. Stories. people who knew him. The best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple.,4,21,
REY,HAN,435,The Jedi were real?,1,4,
HAN,"REY, FINN",436,"I used to wonder that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo -- magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light. Crazy thing is, it's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true.",7,41,

FINN,HAN,442,"Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? Like First Order sympathizers?",6,31,

REY,HAN,462,Clean?,1,1,
HAN,"REY, FINN",463,"Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet.",6,40,
FINN,HAN,464,"We can trust her, right?",1,5,
HAN,FINN,465,"Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years.",2,11,

FINN,REY,507,"I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper. Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know. And raised to do one thing... But my first battle, I made a choice.

FINN,POE,579,"No, no, no. It wasn't just me.",1,7,
POE,FINN,580,"You completed my mission, Finn. That's my jacket?",2,8,
FINN,POE,581,Oh...,1,1,
POE,FINN,582,"No, no, no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man, Finn.",2,13,
FINN,POE,583,Poe-- I need your help.,1,5,
POE,LEIA,584,"General Organa. I'm sorry to interrupt, this is Finn, he needs to talk to",2,14,
LEIA,"FINN, POE",585,"And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did. Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life--",4,22,
FINN,LEIA,586,"Thank you, ma'am-- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner--",2,11,
LEIA,FINN,587,"Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry.",1,8,
POE,"LEIA, FINN",588,Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. He worked on the base.,3,15,
LEIA,FINN,589,We're desperate for anything you can tell us.,2,8,
FINN,LEIA,590,"That's where my friend was taken-- I've got to get there, fast.",2,12,
LEIA,FINN,591,"And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know.",3,18,
DR. KALONIA,CHEWIE,592,That sounds very scary.,1,4,
DR. KALONIA,CHEWIE,593,You must be so brave.,1,5,
THREEPIO,LEIA,594,"General, I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. And even worse, it matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke.",6,37,
LEIA,"HAN, THREEPIO",595,I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home.,3,19,
HAN,LEIA,596,Leia...,1,1,
LEIA,HAN,597,Don't do that.,1,3,
HAN,LEIA,598,Do what?,1,2,
LEIA,HAN,599,Anything.,1,1,
THREEPIO,HAN,600,Princesses.,1,1,
HAN,LEIA,601,I'm trying to be helpful!,1,5,
LEIA,HAN,602,When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star.,2,11,
THREEPIO,BB8,603,BB-8. You're wasting your time.,1,5,
THREEPIO,BB8,604,It is very doubtful that Artoo would have the rest of the map in his backup data.,1,17,
THREEPIO,BB8,605,"I am afraid not. R2D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away. Sadly, he may never be his old self again.",1,26,
HAN,LEIA,606,"Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him.",3,20,
LEIA,HAN,607,You think I want to forget him? I want him back!,2,11,
HAN,LEIA,608,There was nothing we could've done. There was too much Vader in him.,2,13,
LEIA,HAN,609,That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both.,4,28,
HAN,LEIA,610,We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever good at.,3,23,
LEIA,HAN,611,We both did.,1,3,
HAN,LEIA,612,"We lost our son, forever.",1,5,
LEIA,HAN,613,No. It was Snoke. He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You.,5,20,
HAN,LEIA,614,"If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?",1,8,
LEIA,HAN,615,Luke is a Jedi... you're his father. There's still light in him. I know it.,3,15,
ADMIRAL STATURA,LEIA,616,"General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.",2,10,
REY,KYLO REN,617,Where am I?,1,3,
KYLO REN,REY,618,You're my guest.,1,3,
REY,KYLO REN,619,Where are the others?,1,4,
KYLO REN,REY,620,"You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends? You'll be relieved to hear I have no idea. You still want to kill me.",5,25,
REY,KYLO REN,621,That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask.,2,12,
KYLO REN,REY,622,Tell me about the droid.,1,5,
REY,KYLO REN,623,He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --,2,14,
KYLO REN,REY,624,"carrying a section of a navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece. And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger-- You know I can take whatever I want. ...You're so lonely... so afraid to leave... At night, desperate to sleep... you imagine an ocean. I see it-- I see the island... And Han Solo. You feel like he's the father you never had. He would've disappointed you.",15,83,
REY,KYLO REN,625,--Get out of my head--,1,5,
KYLO REN,REY,626,I know you've seen the map. It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too.,4,23,
REY,KYLO REN,627,I'm not giving you anything.,1,5,
KYLO REN,REY,628,We'll see.,1,2,
REY,KYLO REN,629,You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... Darth Vader!,3,13,
SNOKE,KYLO REN,630,"This scavenger, resisted you?",1,4,
KYLO REN,SNOKE,631,"She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows.",2,11,
SNOKE,KYLO REN,632,And the droid?,1,3,
ARMITAGE HUX,SNOKE,633,"Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us. That the girl was all we needed. As a result, the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. They may have the map already.",6,38,
SNOKE,ARMITAGE HUX,634,Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker.,2,11,
ARMITAGE HUX,SNOKE,635,We have their location. We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system.,3,13,
SNOKE,ARMITAGE HUX,636,Good. Then we will crush them once and for all. Prepare the weapon.,2,13,
KYLO REN,SNOKE,637,Supreme Leader. I can get the map from the girl. I just need your guidance.,3,15,
SNOKE,KYLO REN,638,"If what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me.",2,13,
REY,TROOPER GUARD #2,639,"You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.",3,13,
TROOPER GUARD #2,REY,640,What did you say?,1,4,
REY,TROOPER GUARD #2,641,"You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.",3,13,
TROOPER GUARD #2,REY,642,"I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum!",2,6,
REY,TROOPER GUARD #2,643,"You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.",3,13,
TROOPER GUARD #2,REY,644,"I will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.",2,13,
REY,TROOPER GUARD #2,645,And you will drop your weapon.,1,6,
TROOPER GUARD #2,REY,646,And I'll drop my weapon.,1,5,
KYLO REN,NA,647,No. No! GUARDS! GUARDS!,1,4,
ARMITAGE HUX,STARKILLER TECHNICIAN,648,Begin charging the weapon!,1,4,
STARKILLER TECHNICIAN,ARMITAGE HUX,649,"Yes, sir. Weapon charging.",1,4,
POE,NA,650,The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report.,3,10,
SNAP,NA,651,They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself.,3,12,
BRANCE,SNAP,652,A laser cannon?,1,3,
SNAP,BRANCE,653,We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale.,2,11,
MAJOR EMATT,SNAP,654,It's another Death Star.,1,4,
POE,MAJOR EMATT,655,"I wish that were the case, Major. This was the Death Star. And this is Starkiller Base.",3,17,
HAN,NA,656,So it's big.,1,3,
ADMIRAL ACKBAR,NA,657,How is it possible to power a weapon of that size?,2,11,
FINN,NA,658,"It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears.",3,19,
LEIA,NA,659,"The First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now. Our system is the next target.",3,15,
THREEPIO,NA,660,"Oh my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed.",2,8,
HAN,NA,661,"Okay, how do we blow it up? There's always a way to do that.",2,14,
LEIA,NA,662,Han's right.,1,2,
ADMIRAL STATURA,NA,663,"In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base has to have some kind of thermal oscillator...",3,20,
FINN,NA,664,"There is one. Precinct 47. Here. If we can destroy that oscillator, it might de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon.",5,21,
MAJOR EMATT,NA,665,...Maybe the planet.,1,3,
POE,NA,666,We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got.,2,13,
ADMIRAL ACKBAR,NA,667,They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate.,2,9,
HAN,NA,668,We disable the shields.,1,4,
HAN,FINN,669,"Kid, you worked there, what do you got?",2,8,
FINN,HAN,670,I can do it.,1,4,
HAN,FINN,671,I like this guy.,1,4,
FINN,NA,672,"I can disable the shields. But I have to be there, on the planet--",2,14,
HAN,FINN,673,We'll get you there.,1,4,
LEIA,HAN,674,"Han, how?",1,2,
HAN,LEIA,675,"If I told you, you wouldn't like it.",1,8,
POE,NA,676,"So we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun.",3,16,
POE,NA,677,All right. Let's go!,1,4,
HAN,CHEWIE,678,"Chewie, check that donal capitator.",1,5,
HAN,FINN,679,"Come on. Let's go.-- Finn, be careful with those- they're explosives.",3,11,
FINN,HAN,680,Now you tell me?,1,4,
LEIA,HAN,681,"No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave.",2,12,
HAN,LEIA,682,That's why I did it. So you'd miss me.,2,9,
LEIA,HAN,683,I did miss you.,1,4,
HAN,LEIA,684,"It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was...good.",2,11,
LEIA,HAN,685,...Pretty good.,1,2,
HAN,LEIA,686,Some things never change.,1,4,
LEIA,HAN,687,"True. You still drive me crazy. If you see our son again, bring him home.",3,15,
STORMTROOPER,KYLO REN,688,"Sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718. We're searching the area.",2,10,
KYLO REN,STORMTROOPER,689,"She's just beginning to test her powers. The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes.",3,19,
FINN,HAN,690,How are we getting in?,1,5,
HAN,FINN,691,Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through.,4,16,
FINN,HAN,692,We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?!,2,8,
HAN,CHEWIE,693,"Chewie, get ready. And Now!",2,5,

FINN,HAN,700,Sanitation.,1,1,
HAN,FINN,701,Sanitation?,1,1,
HAN,FINN,702,Then how do you know how to disable the shields?,1,10,
FINN,HAN,703,I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.,1,8,
HAN,FINN,704,People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--!,2,11,
FINN,HAN,705,"Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force!",2,9,

FINN,PHASMA,721,Do it.,1,2,
FINN,HAN,722,"Solo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey.",2,16,
HAN,FINN,723,"Don't worry kid, we won't leave here without her.",2,9,
PHASMA,"FINN, HAN, CHEWIE",724,You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all.,3,22,
FINN,"PHASMA, HAN",725,I disagree. ,1,2,
FINN,HAN,726,What do we do with her?,1,6,

FINN,HAN,745,"We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover.",3,20,

FINN,HAN,747,Hell no-- I'll go in find and try to find Rey-- --The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads-- Why are you doing that? Why are you doing-- this? I'm trying to come up with a plan.,8,48,
