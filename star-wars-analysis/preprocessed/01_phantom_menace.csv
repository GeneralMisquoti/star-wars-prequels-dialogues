QUI-GON,MAOI MADAKOR,2,Tell them we wish to board at once.,2,8,870084
MAOI MADAKOR,NUTE,3,With all due respect...,1,4,870085
MAOI MADAKOR,NUTE,4,the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor wish to board immediately. ,1,5,870086
NUTE,MAOI MADAKOR,5,"Yes, of course. As you know, our blockade is perfectly legal...",4,16,870087;870088
NUTE,MAOI MADAKOR,6,and we'd be happy to receive the ambassadors.,2,8,870089
TC-14,"QUI-GON, OBI-WAN",7,"I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please. We are greatly honoured by your visit, Ambassadors. Make yourselves comfortable. My master will be with you shortly.",7,26,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,8,I have a bad feeling about this.,1,7,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,9,I don't sense anything.,1,4,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,10,"It's not about the mission, Master. It's something elsewhere, elusive.",2,10,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,11,"Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here and now, where it belongs.",4,15,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,12,But Master Yoda said I should be mindful of the future.,2,11,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,13,"But not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the living Force, young Padawan.",4,16,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,14,"Yes, Master. How do you think this trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands?",3,15,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,15,These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short.,2,10,
NUTE,TC-14,16,What? What did you say?,1,5,
TC-14,"NUTE, DAULTAY",17,"The ambassadors are Jedi knights, I believe.",2,7,
DAULTAY,NUTE,18,I knew it. They're here to force a settlement.,2,9,
NUTE,DAULTAY,19,Distract them. I will contact Lord Sidious.,2,7,
DAULTAY,NUTE,20,Are you brain-dead? I'm not going in there with two Jedi.,3,11,
DAULTAY,"TC-14, NUTE",21,Send a droid.,1,3,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,22,Is it in their nature to make us wait this long?,2,11,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,23,No. I sense an unusual amount of fear... for something as trivial as this trade dispute.,4,16,
PALPATINE,"NUTE, DAULTAY",24,What is it?,1,3,
DAULTAY,PALPATINE,25,"This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious. The blockade is finished. We dare not go against these Jedi.",4,19,
PALPATINE,"NUTE, DAULTAY",26,"Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slime in my sight again.",2,11,
PALPATINE,NUTE,27,This turn of events is unfortunate. We must accelerate our plans. Begin landing your troops.,3,15,
NUTE,PALPATINE,28,"My lord, is that legal?",1,5,
PALPATINE,NUTE,29,I will make it legal.,1,5,
NUTE,PALPATINE,30,And the Jedi?,1,3,
PALPATINE,NUTE,31,The chancellor should never have brought them into this. Kill them immediately.,3,12,
NUTE,PALPATINE,32,"Yes, Yes, my lord. As you wish.",2,7,

RUNE,NUTE,51,We will not survive this.,1,5,
NUTE,TEY HOW,52,Close the blast doors!,1,4,
NUTE,NA,53,That will hold them.,1,4,
RUNE,NUTE,54,They are still coming through.,1,5,
NUTE,RUNE,55,This is impossible!,1,3,
RUNE,NUTE,56,Where are those droidekas?,1,4,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,57,Master! Destroyers! They have shield generators!,2,6,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,58,It's a standoff. Let's go.,2,5,
RUNE,NUTE,59,They're no match for droidekas.,1,5,
TEY HOW,NUTE,60,Sir! They've gone up the ventilation shaft.,3,7,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,61,Battle droids.,1,2,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,62,It's an invasion army.,1,4,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,63,This is an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet.,7,32,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,64,"You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were short.",3,11,
TEY HOW,NUTE,65,"Sir, a transmission from the planet.",2,6,
RUNE,NUTE,66,It's Queen Amidala herself.,1,4,
NUTE,RUNE,67,At last we are getting results.,1,6,
NUTE,PADME,68,"Again you come before us, Your Highness.",2,7,
PADME,NUTE,69,"You will not be so pleased when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy. Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.",4,23,
NUTE,PADME,70,I was not aware of such failure.,1,7,
PADME,NUTE,71,I have word that the chancellor's ambassadors are with you now... and that you have been commanded to reach settlement.,4,20,
NUTE,PADME,72,I know nothing of any ambassadors. You must be mistaken.,3,10,
PADME,NUTE,73,"Beware, Viceroy. The Federation has gone too far this time.",3,10,
NUTE,PADME,74,We would never do anything without the approval of the senate. You assume too much.,3,15,
PADME,NUTE,75,We will see.,1,3,
RUNE,NUTE,76,She's right. The senate will never...,1,6,
NUTE,RUNE,77,It's too late now.,1,4,
RUNE,NUTE,78,Do you think she suspects an attack?,1,7,
NUTE,RUNE,79,I don't know. But we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there.,3,14,
PALPATINE,NA,80,Negotiations haven't started because the ambassadors aren't there? How could that be true? I have assurances from the chancellor his ambassadors did arrive.,5,23,
[DISTORTED VOICE],NA,81,It must... handiwork... negotiate... ambassadors... - nobody would...,3,8,
PADME,PALPATINE,82,Senator Palpatine. What's happening?,2,4,
CAPT. PANAKA,PALPATINE,83,Check the transmission generator.,1,4,
BIBBLE,PADME,84,A communications disruption can mean only one thing: Invasion.,2,9,
PADME,BIBBLE,85,The Federation would not dare go that far.,2,8,
CAPT. PANAKA,"PADME, BIBBLE",86,"The senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be finished.",2,11,
PADME,BIBBLE,87,We must continue to rely on negotiation.,2,7,
BIBBLE,PADME,88,Negotiation? We've lost all communications.,2,5,
BIBBLE,NA,89,And where are the chancellor's ambassadors?,2,6,
CAPT. PANAKA,PADME,90,"This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security volunteers will be no match... against a battle-hardened Federation army.",6,19,
PADME,CAPT. PANAKA,91,I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.,2,14,
OOM-9,"RUNE, NUTE",92,"Yes, Viceroy?",1,2,
RUNE,OOM-9,93,"Captain, we've searched the ship... and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have gotten on one of your landing craft.",4,23,
OOM-9,"RUNE, NUTE",94,"If they're down here, sir, we'll fnd them.",2,8,
NUTE,OOM-9,95,Use caution. These Jedi are not to be underestimated.,2,9,

QUI-GON,CAPT. PANAKA,243,It's controlled by the Hutts.,1,5,
CAPT. PANAKA,"QUI-GON, OBI-WAN",244,You can't take Her Royal Highness there. The Hutts are gangsters. If they discovered her...,3,15,

QUI-GON,PADME,282,Stay close to me.,1,4,
QUI-GON,"PADME, JAR JAR",283,"Moisture farms, for the most part. Some indigenous tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one... are havens for those that don't wish to be found.",7,27,

PADME,ANAKIN,372,He's wonderful.,1,2,
ANAKIN,PADME,373,You really like him? He's a protocol droid to help Mom. Watch.,3,12,
THREEPIO,ANAKIN,374,Where is everybody?,1,3,
ANAKIN,ANAKIN,375,Whoops.,1,1,
THREEPIO,"ANAKIN, PADME",376,"Oh, hello. I am C-3PO, human cyborg relations. How might I serve you?",4,13,
PADME,ANAKIN,377,He's perfect.,1,2,

PALPATINE,"SABE, OBI-WAN, QUI-GON",386,The death toll is catastrophic. We must bow to their wishes. You must contact me.,3,15,recording
OBI-WAN,SABE,387,It's a trick. Send no reply. Send no transmissions of any kind.,3,12,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,388,It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.,2,9,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,389,"What if it is true, and the people are dying?",2,10,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,390,"Either way, we're running out of time.",2,7,
DARTH MAUL,PALPATINE,391,"Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I will fnd them quickly, Master.",3,15,
PALPATINE,DARTH MAUL,392,Move against the Jedi first. You will then have no difficulty in taking the queen to Naboo... to sign the treaty.,4,21,
DARTH MAUL,PALPATINE,393,At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge.,3,15,

ANAKIN,"QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR",398,And they blow you up! Boom!,1,6,
JAR JAR,"ANAKIN, SHMI",399,How wude!,1,2,
PADME,"SHMI, ANAKIN",400,I can't believe there's still slavery in the galaxy. The Republic's antislavery laws...,3,13,
SHMI,PADME,401,The Republic doesn't exist out here. We must survive on our own.,2,12,
JAR JAR,"QUI-GON, PADME, ANAKIN, SHMI",402,Xcuse me.,1,2,
ANAKIN,"QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR",403,Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?,1,6,
QUI-GON,"ANAKIN, PADME, JAR JAR, SHMI",404,"They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.",3,9,
ANAKIN,"QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR",405,I'm the only human who can do it.,1,8,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,406,You must have Jedi reflexes if you race pods.,2,9,
QUI-GON,JAR JAR,407,Don't do that again.,1,4,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,408,"You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?",1,6,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,409,What makes you think that?,1,5,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,410,I saw your laser sword. Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.,3,12,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,411,Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him.,2,10,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,412,I don't think so. No one can kill a Jedi.,2,10,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,413,I wish that were so.,1,5,
ANAKIN,"QUI-GON, PADME, SHMI",414,I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the slaves.,3,17,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,415,Have you come to free us?,1,6,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,416,"No, I'm afraid not.",1,4,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,417,I think you have. Why else would you be here?,2,10,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,418,"I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin.",2,8,
QUI-GON,"ANAKIN, SHMI",419,"We're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic... on a very important mission.",3,17,
ANAKIN,"QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR",420,How did you end up out here in the outer rim?,2,11,
PADME,ANAKIN,421,"Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it.",2,13,
ANAKIN,"QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR",422,I can help. I can fix anything.,2,7,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,423,I believe you can. But first we must acquire the parts we need.,3,13,
JAR JAR,"ANAKIN, QUI-GON, PADME, SHMI",424,Wit no-nutten mula to trade.,1,5,
PADME,"ANAKIN, SHMI, QUI-GON, JAR JAR",425,These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.,2,10,
SHMI,"PADME, QUI-GON, JAR JAR",426,Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races.,2,10,
QUI-GON,SHMI,427,Podracing. Greed can be a powerful ally.,2,7,
ANAKIN,"QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR",428,I built a racer. It's the fastest ever. There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve.,4,16,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,429,You could enter my pod.,1,5,
SHMI,ANAKIN,430,"Anakin, Watto won't let you.",1,5,
ANAKIN,SHMI,431,Watto doesn't know I've built it. You could make him think it was yours... and get him to let me pilot it for you.,5,24,
SHMI,ANAKIN,432,I don't want you to race. It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.,4,17,
ANAKIN,SHMI,433,"But, Mom, I love it. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.",3,17,
SHMI,ANAKIN,434,Anakin.,1,1,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,435,Your mother's right.,1,3,
QUI-GON,"ANAKIN, SHMI",436,Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who can help us?,2,11,
SHMI,QUI-GON,437,No.,1,1,
ANAKIN,SHMI,438,"Mom, you say the biggest problem in this universe is nobody helps each other.",2,14,
PADME,SHMI,439,I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We'll find some other way.,3,16,
SHMI,"QUI-GON, PADME",440,"No. There is no other way. I may not like it, but he can help you. He was meant to help you.",4,22,
PADME,QUI-GON,441,Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know? The queen will not approve.,4,19,
QUI-GON,PADME,442,The queen doesn't need to know.,1,6,
PADME,QUI-GON,443,"Well, I don't approve.",1,4,
WATTO,QUI-GON,444,"The boy tells me you want to sponsor him in the race. How can you do this? Not on the Republic credits, I think.",5,24,
QUI-GON,WATTO,445,My ship will be the entry fee.,1,7,
WATTO,QUI-GON,446,"Not bad! Not bad, huh? Nubian, huh?",3,7,
QUI-GON,WATTO,447,"It's in good order, except for the parts I need.",2,10,
WATTO,"QUI-GON, ANAKIN",448,What would the boy ride? He smashed up my pod in the last race. It would take some long time to fx it.,3,23,
ANAKIN,"WATTO, QUI-GON",449,"It wasn't my fault. Really. Sebulba flashed me with his vents. I actually saved the pod, mostly.",4,17,
WATTO,ANAKIN,450,That you did.,1,3,
WATTO,QUI-GON,451,"The boy's good. No doubts there, huh?",2,7,
QUI-GON,WATTO,452,I have acquired a pod in a game of chance. The fastest ever built.,3,14,
WATTO,QUI-GON,453,"I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it, huh? So, you supply the pod and the entry fee... and I supply the boy. We split the winnings 50-50, I think, huh?",7,33,
QUI-GON,WATTO,454,"If it's going to be 50-50... I suggest you front the cash for the entry. If we win... you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need. And if we lose, you keep my ship. Either way, you win.",9,43,
WATTO,QUI-GON,455,Deal!,1,1,
WATTO,ANAKIN,456,"Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.",2,7,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,457,"What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here a very long time.",3,15,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,458,"Well, it's too dangerous to call for help... and a ship without a power supply isn't going to get us anywhere. And... there's something about this boy.",6,27,
QUI-GON,SHMI,459,You should be very proud of your son. He gives without any thought of reward.,3,15,
SHMI,QUI-GON,460,"Well, he knows nothing of greed. He has...",2,8,
QUI-GON,SHMI,461,He has special powers.,1,4,
SHMI,QUI-GON,462,Yes.,1,1,
QUI-GON,SHMI,463,He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It's a Jedi trait.,5,20,
SHMI,QUI-GON,464,He deserves better than a slave's life.,2,7,
QUI-GON,SHMI,465,"Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identifed him early. The Force is unusually strong with him. That much is clear. Who was his father?",5,28,
SHMI,QUI-GON,466,"There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him. I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?",5,22,
QUI-GON,SHMI,467,I don't know. I didn't actually come here to free slaves.,3,11,
KITSTER,ANAKIN,468,Hi Ani!,1,2,

KITSTER,ANAKIN,470,"Wow, a real astro droid!",1,5,
KITSTER,ANAKIN,471,How do you get so lucky?,1,6,
ANAKIN,KITSTER,472,That isn't the half of it. I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.,2,12,

ANAKIN,"PADME, QUI-GON, JAR JAR",494,It's working! It's working!,2,4,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,495,"Stay still, Ani. Let me clean this cut.",2,8,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,496,There's so many. Do they all have a system of planets?,2,11,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,497,Most of them.,1,3,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,498,Has anyone been to 'em all?,1,6,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,499,Not likely.,1,2,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,500,I wanna be the frst one to see 'em all.,2,10,

QUI-GON,ANAKIN,502,There we are. Good as new.,2,6,
SHMI,ANAKIN,503,"Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.",1,7,

QUI-GON,ANAKIN,505,"Checking your blood for infections. Go on. You have a big day tomorrow. Sleep well, Ani.",4,16,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,506,Obi-Wan?,1,1,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,507,"Yes, Master?",1,2,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,508,I need an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.,2,11,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,509,Wait a minute.,1,3,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,510,I need a midi-chlorian count.,1,5,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,511,"The reading is off the chart. Over 20,000. Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high.",4,18,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,512,No Jedi has.,1,3,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,513,What does that mean?,1,4,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,514,I'm not sure.,1,3,
WATTO,QUI-GON,515,I wanna see your spaceship the moment the race is over.,2,11,
QUI-GON,WATTO,516,"Patience, my blue friend. You'll have your winnings before the suns set. And we'll be far away from here.",4,19,
WATTO,QUI-GON,517,"Not if your ship belongs to me, I think, huh? I warn you, no funny business.",3,16,
QUI-GON,WATTO,518,You don't think Anakin can win?,1,6,
WATTO,QUI-GON,519,"Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit to your race... but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.",5,26,
JAR JAR,QUI-GON,520,"Oh, no!",1,2,
QUI-GON,WATTO,521,Why do you think that?,1,5,
WATTO,QUI-GON,522,He always wins! I am betting heavily on Sebulba.,2,9,
QUI-GON,WATTO,523,I'll take that bet.,1,4,
WATTO,QUI-GON,524,You What?,1,2,
QUI-GON,WATTO,525,"I'll wager my new racing pod against, say... the boy and his mother.",3,13,

WATTO,QUI-GON,528,"Well, we'll let fate decide, huh? I just happen to have a chance cube here. Blue, it's the boy. Red... his mother. You won this small toss, outlander... but you won't win the race! So it makes little difference!",10,39,
WATTO,ANAKIN,529,Better stop your friend's betting or I'll end up owning him too.,2,12,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,530,What'd he mean by that?,1,5,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,531,I'll tell you later.,1,4,
QUI-GON,SHMI,532,Good morning.,1,2,
THREEPIO,R2D2,533,"Oh, my.",1,2,

ANAKIN,PADME,540,"Well, not exactly.",1,3,
PADME,ANAKIN,541,Not even finished?,1,3,
ANAKIN,PADME,542,Kitster's right. I will this time.,2,6,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,543,Of course you will.,1,4,
BEED,NA,544,That's absolutely right. And a big turnout here from all corners of the outer rim territories. I see the contestants are making their way out onto the starting grid.,5,29,
FODE,NA,545,I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund System.,2,8,
BEED,NA,546,Two-time winner Boles Roor.,1,4,

And back again, it's the mighty Dud Bolt... with that incredible racing machine, the Vulptereen 327. And hoping for a big win today... Ody Mandrell, with his record-setting pit droid team. And a late entry, young Anakin Skywalker... a local boy. I see the flags are moving out onto the track.",18,71,

QUI-GON,SHMI,564,He's fne.,1,2,

FODE,NA,572,Wait. Little Skywalker has stalled. It looks like Quadinaros is having engine trouble also.,4,14,
JAR JAR,NA,573,"Come on, Ani!",1,3,
FODE,NA,574,And there goes Skywalker!,1,4,
JAR JAR,NA,575,"Go, Ani, go!",1,3,
FODE,NA,576,He will be hard-pressed to catch up with the leaders. Looks like a few Tusken Raiders are camped out... on the canyon dune turn. There goes Quadinaros' power coupling.,7,29,
POD RACER,NA,577,"Oh, no!",1,2,
THREEPIO,"R2D2, KITSTER, GREEDO",578,Where is Master Anakin?,1,4,
PADME,"SHMI, QUI-GON, JAR JAR",579,Look. Here he comes.,1,4,

BEED,NA,588,"Sebulba! Amazing! A quick control thrust, and he's back on course!",3,11,
JAR JAR,"PADME, SHMI, QUI-GON",589,Did he crash-ed?,1,3,
FODE,NA,590,Skywalker's in trouble! Sebulba takes the lead! He's catching Sebulba!,3,10,
JAR JAR,NA,591,"Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!",1,4,
FODE,NA,592,That little human being is out of his mind! They're side by side!,3,13,

GREEDO,NA,594,Yay!,1,1,
THREEPIO,R2D2,595,I can't believe it.,1,4,

ANAKIN,SHMI,598,"Mom, I did it! Yay!",1,5,
JAR JAR,ANAKIN,599,"Good going, Ani!",1,3,

SHMI,ANAKIN,601,"It's so wonderful, Ani. You have brought hope to those who have none. I'm so very proud of you.",4,19,
WATTO,QUI-GON,602,You! You swindled me. You knew the boy was going to win. Somehow you knew it. I lost everything.,5,19,
QUI-GON,WATTO,603,"Whenever you gamble, my friend, eventually you lose. Bring the parts to the main hangar. I'll come by your shop later on so you can release the boy.",6,28,
WATTO,QUI-GON,604,You can't have him. It wasn't a fair bet.,2,9,
QUI-GON,WATTO,605,Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts? I'm sure they can settle this.,3,15,
WATTO,QUI-GON,606,Take him.,1,2,
JAR JAR,OBI-WAN,607,Hidoe!,1,1,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,608,"Well, we have all the essential parts we need.",2,9,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,609,I'm going back. Some unfinished business. I won't be long.,3,10,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,610,Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life-form?,2,10,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,611,It's the boy who's responsible for getting us these parts. Get this hyperdrive generator installed.,4,15,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,612,"Yes, Master. That shouldn't take long.",2,6,
QUI-GON,ANIMAL,613,Come on. Hup!,1,3,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,614,Hey. These are yours.,1,4,

QUI-GON,"SHMI, ANAKIN",618,And he has been freed.,1,5,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,619,What? ,1,1,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,620,You're no longer a slave.,1,5,
ANAKIN,SHMI,621,Did you hear that?,1,4,
SHMI,ANAKIN,622,"Now you can make your dreams come true, Ani. You are free.",3,12,
SHMI,QUI-GON,623,Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?,2,12,
QUI-GON,SHMI,624,Yes. Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident.,3,11,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,625,You mean I get to come with you in your starship?,2,11,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,626,"Anakin... training to become a Jedi is not an easy challenge... and even if you succeed, it's a hard life.",5,20,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,627,But I wanna go. It's what I've always dreamed of doing.,2,11,
ANAKIN,SHMI,628,"Can I go, Mom?",1,4,
SHMI,ANAKIN,629,Anakin... this path has been placed before you. The choice is yours alone.,4,13,
ANAKIN,SHMI,630,I wanna do it.,1,4,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,631,Then pack your things. We haven't much time.,2,8,
ANAKIN,ANAKIN,632,Yippee!,1,1,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,633,What about Mom? Is she free too?,1,7,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,634,"I tried to free your mother, Ani, but Watto wouldn't have it.",2,12,
ANAKIN,SHMI,635,"You're coming with us, aren't you, Mom?",2,7,
SHMI,ANAKIN,636,"Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let go.",3,17,
ANAKIN,SHMI,637,I don't want things to change.,1,6,
SHMI,ANAKIN,638,But you can't stop the change... any more than you can stop the suns from setting. I love you. Now hurry.,5,21,
SHMI,QUI-GON,639,Thank you.,1,2,
QUI-GON,SHMI,640,I'll watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all right?,3,13,
SHMI,QUI-GON,641,Yeah.,1,1,
THREEPIO,ANAKIN,642,"Oh, Oh my. Oh! Hello, Master Anakin.",1,7,
ANAKIN,THREEPIO,643,"Well, 3PO, I've been freed... and I'm going away in a starship.",2,12,
THREEPIO,ANAKIN,644,"Master Anakin, you are my maker and I wish you well. However, I should prefer it if I were a little more completed.",4,23,
ANAKIN,THREEPIO,645,"I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, 3PO... give you coverings and all. I'm gonna miss working on you. You've been a great pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything.",7,34,
THREEPIO,ANAKIN,646,Sell me?,1,2,
ANAKIN,THREEPIO,647,Bye.,1,1,
THREEPIO,ANAKIN,648,"Oh, my.",1,2,
ANAKIN,SHMI,649,"I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.",2,10,
SHMI,ANAKIN,650,Ani...,1,1,
ANAKIN,SHMI,651,Will I ever see you again?,1,6,
SHMI,ANAKIN,652,What does your heart tell you?,1,6,
ANAKIN,SHMI,653,I hope so. Yes. I guess.,3,6,
SHMI,ANAKIN,654,Then we will see each other again.,2,7,
ANAKIN,SHMI,655,"I will come back and free you, Mom. I promise.",3,10,
SHMI,ANAKIN,656,"Now, be brave... and don't look back. Don't look back.",3,10,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,657,"Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!",2,5,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,658,Anakin! Drop! Go! Tell them to take off!,3,8,
CAPT. PANAKA,"RIC OLIE, OBI-WAN",659,Qui-Gon's in trouble.,1,3,
OBI-WAN,RIC OLIE,660,Take off. Over there. Fly low.,2,6,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,661,Are you all right?,1,4,
QUI-GON,"ANAKIN, OBI-WAN",662,I think so.,1,3,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,663,What was it?,1,3,
QUI-GON,"OBI-WAN, ANAKIN",664,I'm not sure... but it was well-trained in the Jedi arts.,3,11,
R2D2,NA,665,BEEPS TWICE,1,2,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,666,My guess is it was after the queen.,2,8,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,667,What are we gonna do about it?,1,7,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,668,We shall be patient.,1,4,
QUI-GON,"ANAKIN, OBI-WAN",669,Anakin Skywalker... meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.,2,5,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,670,Hi! You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.,2,9,
NUTE,BIBBLE,671,"Your queen is lost, your people are starving... and you, Governor, are going to die... much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.",6,22,
BIBBLE,NUTE,672,This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people have decided.,4,13,
NUTE,NA,673,Take him away.,1,3,
OOM-9,NUTE,674,My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps... for these rumoured underwater villages. They will not stay hidden for long.,6,22,
BIBBLE,PADME,675,The death toll is catastrophic. We must bow to their wishes. You must contact me.,3,15,recording
PADME,ANAKIN,676,You all right?,1,3,
ANAKIN,PADME,677,It's very cold.,1,3,
PADME,ANAKIN,678,"You come from a warm planet, Ani. A little too warm for my taste. Space is cold.",5,17,
ANAKIN,PADME,679,You seem sad.,1,3,
PADME,ANAKIN,680,"The queen is worried. Her people are suffering, dying. She must convince the senate to intervene or... I'm not sure what'll happen.",5,22,
ANAKIN,PADME,681,I made this for you... so you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet. It'll bring you good fortune.,5,22,
PADME,ANAKIN,682,"It's beautiful. But I don't need this to remember you by. Many things will change when we reach the capital, Ani... but my caring for you will remain.",6,28,
ANAKIN,PADME,683,"I care for you, too, only l...",1,7,
PADME,ANAKIN,684,Miss your mother.,1,3,
RIC OLIE,ANAKIN,685,Coruscant. The entire planet is one big city. There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle. And look over there. Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.,5,22,
PALPATINE,SABE,686,"It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. With the communications breakdown, we've been very concerned. I'm anxious to hear your report on the situation. May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.",8,34,
VALORUM,SABE,687,"Welcome, Your Highness. It's an honour to fnally meet you in person.",3,12,
SABE,PALPATINE,688,"Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.",1,4,
VALORUM,SABE,689,I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the current situation. I've called for a special session of the senate to hear your position.,4,26,
SABE,VALORUM,690,"I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor.",2,6,
PALPATINE,SABE,691,There is a question of procedure... but I'm confdent we can overcome it.,4,13,
QUI-GON,VALORUM,692,I must speak with the Jedi Council immediately. The situation has become much more complicated.,4,15,
PADME,ANAKIN,693,"Ani, come on.",1,3,
JAR JAR,ANAKIN,694,"Da queen's a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks. Pitty hot.",3,10,
PALPATINE,PADME,695,"There is no civility, only politics. The Republic is not what it once was. The senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates. There is no interest in the common good. I must be frank, Your Majesty. There is little chance the senate will act on the invasion.",11,47,
PADME,PALPATINE,696,"Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope. If I may say so, Your Majesty... the chancellor has little real power. He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption. The bureaucrats are in charge now. What options have we?",9,39,
PALPATINE,PADME,697,Our best choice would be to push for the election... of a stronger supreme chancellor... one who could control the bureaucrats... and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.,9,37,
PADME,PALPATINE,698,He has been our strongest supporter.,2,6,
PALPATINE,PADME,699,Our only other choice would be to submit a plea to the courts.,2,13,
PADME,PALPATINE,700,"The courts take even longer to decide things than the senate. Our people are dying, Senator. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.",5,25,
PALPATINE,PADME,701,"To be realistic, Your Majesty... I think we're going to have to accept Federation control... for the time being.",4,19,
PADME,PALPATINE,702,That is something I cannot do.,1,6,
QUI-GON,"YODA, MACE WINDU, KI-ADI-MUNDI",703,He was trained in the Jedi arts. My only conclusion can be that it was a Sith lord.,3,18,
KI-ADI-MUNDI,QUI-GON,704,Impossible. The Sith have been extinct for a millennium.,3,9,
MACE WINDU,YODA,705,I do not believe the Sith could have returned without us knowing.,2,12,
YODA,MACE WINDU,706,"Hard to see, the dark side is.",2,7,
MACE WINDU,QUI-GON,707,We will use all our resources to unravel this mystery. We will discover the identity of your attacker. May the Force be with you.,5,24,

QUI-GON,YODA,709,"With your permission, my master... I have encountered a vergence in the Force.",3,13,
YODA,QUI-GON,710,"A vergence, you say.",1,4,
MACE WINDU,QUI-GON,711,Located around a person?,1,4,
QUI-GON,MACE WINDU,712,A boy. His cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians... I have seen in a life-form. It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians.,6,25,
MACE WINDU,QUI-GON,713,You refer to the prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the Force. You believe it's this boy?,3,20,
QUI-GON,MACE WINDU,714,I don't presume to...,1,4,
YODA,QUI-GON,715,But you do. Revealed your opinion is.,2,7,
QUI-GON,YODA,716,"I request the boy be tested, Master.",2,7,
YODA,QUI-GON,717,"Oh? Trained as a Jedi you request for him, hmm?",2,10,
QUI-GON,YODA,718,Finding him was the will of the Force. I have no doubt of that.,3,14,
MACE WINDU,QUI-GON,719,"Bring him before us, then.",1,5,
GUARD,HANDMAIDEN,720,The boy's here to see Padme.,1,6,
HANDMAIDEN,GUARD,721,Let him in.,1,3,
HANDMAIDEN,ANAKIN,722,"I'm sorry, Ani, but Padme's not here right now.",2,9,
PADME,HANDMAIDEN,723,Who is it?,1,3,
HANDMAIDEN,PADME,724,"Anakin Skywalker to see Padme, Your Highness.",2,7,
PADME,ANAKIN,725,I've sent Padme on an errand.,1,6,
ANAKIN,PADME,726,"I'm on my way to the Jedi temple... to start my training, I hope. I may never see her again, so I came to say goodbye.",5,26,
PADME,ANAKIN,727,We will tell her for you. We are sure her heart goes with you.,2,14,
ANAKIN,PADME,728,"Thank you, Your Highness.",1,4,

LOTT DOD,NA,731,This is outrageous! I object to the senator's statements.,3,9,
VALORUM,NA,732,The chair does not recognize the senator from the Trade Federation at this time.,2,14,
PALPATINE,NA,733,"To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala... recently elected ruler of the Naboo... who speaks on our behalf.",5,19,
PADME,NA,734,Honourable representatives of the Republic... I come to you under the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by the droid armies of the Trade...,6,27,
LOTT DOD,NA,735,I object! There is no proof! This is incredible. We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth.,5,21,
AKS MOE,NA,736,The Congress of Malastare... concurs with the honourable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commission must be appointed.,4,18,
VALORUM,NA,737,The point...,1,2,
MAS AMEDDA,VALORUM,738,"Excuse me, Chancellor.",1,3,
PALPATINE,PADME,739,"Enter the bureaucrat. The true rulers of the Republic. And on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will disappear.",6,28,
VALORUM,PADME,740,The point is conceded. Will you defer your motion to allow a commission... to explore the validity of your accusations?,5,20,
PADME,NA,741,I will not defer. I've come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die... while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action... I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a vote of no confdence... in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.,13,61,
SENATORS,NA,742,Vote now! Vote now!,1,4,
MAS AMEDDA,NA,743,Order!,1,1,
PALPATINE,PADME,744,Now they will elect a new chancellor... a strong chancellor... one who will not let our tragedy continue.,5,18,

ANAKIN,YODA,761,What has that got to do with anything?,2,8,
YODA,ANAKIN,762,Everything. Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.,6,27,

KI-ADI-MUNDI,"QUI-GON, ANAKIN, OBI-WAN",783,The Force is strong with him.,1,6,
QUI-GON,"KI-ADI-MUNDI, MACE WINDU, YODA",784,"He is to be trained, then?",1,6,
MACE WINDU,QUI-GON,785,"No, he will not be trained.",1,6,
QUI-GON,MACE WINDU,786,No?,1,1,
MACE WINDU,QUI-GON,787,He is too old.,1,4,
QUI-GON,"KI-ADI-MUNDI, MACE WINDU, YODA",788,He is the chosen one. You must see it.,2,9,
YODA,QUI-GON,789,Clouded this boy's future is.,1,5,
QUI-GON,YODA,790,"I will train him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.",3,12,
YODA,QUI-GON,791,"An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible to take on a second.",2,11,
MACE WINDU,QUI-GON,792,The code forbids it.,1,4,
QUI-GON,YODA,793,Obi-Wan is ready.,1,3,
OBI-WAN,YODA,794,I am ready to face the trials.,1,7,
YODA,"QUI-GON, OBI-WAN",795,Our own counsel we will keep on who is ready.,2,10,
QUI-GON,YODA,796,He is headstrong and he has much to learn of the living Force... but he is capable. There is little more he can learn from me.,5,26,
YODA,QUI-GON,797,Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.,2,7,
MACE WINDU,"QUI-GON, OBI-WAN",798,Now is not the time for this. The senate is voting for a new supreme chancellor... and Queen Amidala is returning home... which will put pressure on the Federation and could widen the confrontation.,7,34,
KI-ADI-MUNDI,"QUI-GON, OBI-WAN",799,And draw out the queen's attacker.,1,6,
MACE WINDU,"QUI-GON, OBI-WAN",800,Go with the queen to Naboo and discover the identity of this dark warrior. This is the clue we need... to unravel the mystery of the Sith.,5,27,
YODA,"QUI-GON, OBI-WAN",801,May the Force be with you.,1,6,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,802,"It's not disrespect, Master. It's the truth.",2,7,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,803,From your point of view.,1,5,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,804,The boy is dangerous. They all sense it. Why can't you?,2,11,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,805,His fate is uncertain. He's not dangerous. The council will decide Anakin's future. That should be enough for you. Now get on board.,6,23,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,806,"Qui-Gon, sir, I don't want to be a problem.",2,9,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,807,"You won't be, Ani. I'm not allowed to train you... so I want you to watch me and be mindful. Always remember: Your focus determines your reality. Stay close to me and you'll be safe.",8,35,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,808,"Master, sir... I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians. I've been wondering... What are midi-chlorians?",5,14,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,809,Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life-form... that resides within all living cells.,4,11,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,810,They live inside me?,1,4,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,811,"Inside your cells, yes. And we are symbionts with them.",2,10,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,812,Symbionts?,1,1,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,813,"Life-forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist... and we would have no knowledge of the Force. They continually speak to us... telling us the will of the Force. When you learn to quiet your mind... you'll hear them speaking to you.",11,47,
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,814,I don't understand.,1,3,
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,815,"With time and training, Ani, you will. You will.",2,9,
QUI-GON,PADME,816,"Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to continue to serve and protect you.",2,13,
PADME,QUI-GON,817,I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears that the Federation means to destroy me.,3,14,

ANAKIN,R2D2,820,"Come on, Artoo.",1,3,
PALPATINE,NUTE,821,Is the planet secure?,1,4,
NUTE,PALPATINE,822,We have taken over the last pockets of primitive life-forms. We are in complete control of the planet now.,4,19,

RIC OLIE,ANAKIN,828,You catch on pretty quick.,1,5,
CAPT. PANAKA,PADME,829,As soon as we land... the Federation will arrest you and force you to sign the treaty.,3,17,
QUI-GON,PADME,830,I agree. I'm not sure what you wish to accomplish by this.,3,12,
PADME,"QUI-GON, CAPT. PANAKA",831,I will take back what's ours.,1,6,
CAPT. PANAKA,PADME,832,"There are too few of us, Your Highness. We have no army.",3,12,

OBI-WAN,"CAPT. PANAKA, RIC OLIE",838,It's a droid control ship.,1,5,
CAPT. PANAKA,"OBI-WAN, RIC OLIE",839,They've probably spotted us.,1,4,

QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,842,Good.,1,1,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,843,Do you think the queen's idea will work?,2,8,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,844,The Gungans will not be easily swayed. And we cannot use our power to help her.,4,16,
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,845,"I'm sorry for my behaviour, Master. It's not my place to disagree with you about the boy. And I am grateful you think I'm ready to take the trials.",6,29,
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,846,"You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan. And you're a much wiser man than I am. I foresee you will become a great Jedi knight.",6,24,

CAPT. PANAKA,"PADME, QUI-GON",878,"Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards formed an underground resistance movement. I brought back as many of the leaders as I could. The Federation army's also much larger than we thought... and much stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think that we can win.",10,52,
PADME,"QUI-GON, CAPT. PANAKA",879,The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw the droid army away from the cities.,3,16,
PADME,R2D2,880,Artoo.,1,1,
PADME,"QUI-GON, CAPT. PANAKA",881,"We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance... Captain Panaka will create a diversion. Then we can enter the palace and capture the viceroy. Without the viceroy, they will be lost and confused.",10,45,

QUI-GON,PADME,883,The viceroy will be well-guarded.,1,5,

BOSS NASS,"QUI-GON, PADME, CAPT. PANAKA",886,Wesa ready to do our-san part. We have a plan which should immobilize the droid army. We will send what pilots we have... to knock out the droid control ship orbiting the planet.,7,33,
QUI-GON,PADME,887,"A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons on your fghters may not penetrate the shields.",4,17,
OBI-WAN,PADME,888,"And there's an even bigger danger. If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness... he will return with another droid army.",5,19,
