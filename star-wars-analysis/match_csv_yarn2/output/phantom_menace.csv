ANAKIN,QUI-GON,Why else would you be here?,870624
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,"I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin.",870625
QUI-GON,"ANAKIN, SHMI","We're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic.",870626
QUI-GON,"ANAKIN, SHMI",on a very important mission.,870627
ANAKIN,"QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR",How did you end up out here in the outer rim?,870628
PADME,ANAKIN,"Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it.",870629
ANAKIN,"QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR",I can help.,870630
ANAKIN,"QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR",I can fix anything.,870631
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,I believe you can.,870631
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,But first we must acquire the parts we need.,870632
JAR JAR,"ANAKIN, QUI-GON, PADME, SHMI",Wit no-nutten mula to trade.,870633
PADME,"ANAKIN, SHMI, QUI-GON, JAR JAR",These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.,870634
SHMI,"PADME, QUI-GON, JAR JAR",Gambling.,870635
SHMI,"PADME, QUI-GON, JAR JAR",Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races.,870635
QUI-GON,SHMI,Podracing.,870636
QUI-GON,SHMI,Greed can be a powerful ally.,870636
ANAKIN,"QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR",I built a racer.,870637
ANAKIN,"QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR",It's the fastest ever.,870637
ANAKIN,"QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR",There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve.,870638
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,You could enter my pod.,870639
SHMI,ANAKIN,"Anakin, Watto won't let you.",870640
ANAKIN,SHMI,Watto doesn't know I've built it.,870640
ANAKIN,SHMI,You could make him think it was yours.,870641
ANAKIN,SHMI,and get him to let me pilot it for you.,870642
SHMI,ANAKIN,I don't want you to race.,870643
SHMI,ANAKIN,It's awful.,870643
SHMI,ANAKIN,I die every time Watto makes you do it.,870643
ANAKIN,SHMI,"But, Mom, I love it.",870644
ANAKIN,SHMI,The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.,870645
SHMI,ANAKIN,Anakin.,870646
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,Your mother's right.,870647
QUI-GON,"ANAKIN, SHMI",Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who can help us?,870648
SHMI,QUI-GON,No.,870649
ANAKIN,SHMI,"Mom, you say the biggest problem in this universe is nobody helps each other.",870650
PADME,SHMI,I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger.,870651
PADME,SHMI,We'll find some other way.,870652
SHMI,"QUI-GON, PADME",No.,870653
SHMI,"QUI-GON, PADME",There is no other way.,870654
SHMI,"QUI-GON, PADME","I may not like it, but he can help you.",870655
SHMI,"QUI-GON, PADME",He was meant to help you.,870656
PADME,QUI-GON,Are you sure about this?,870657
PADME,QUI-GON,Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know?,870658
PADME,QUI-GON,The queen will not approve.,870659
QUI-GON,PADME,The queen doesn't need to know.,870660
PADME,QUI-GON,"Well, I don't approve.",870661
WATTO,QUI-GON,The boy tells me you want to sponsor him in the race.,870662
WATTO,QUI-GON,How can you do this?,870663
WATTO,QUI-GON,"Not on the Republic credits, I think.",870663
QUI-GON,WATTO,My ship will be the entry fee.,870664
WATTO,QUI-GON,Not bad!,870665
WATTO,QUI-GON,"Not bad, huh?",870666
WATTO,QUI-GON,"Nubian, huh?",870666
QUI-GON,WATTO,"It's in good order, except for the parts I need.",870667
WATTO,"QUI-GON, ANAKIN",What would the boy ride?,870668
WATTO,"QUI-GON, ANAKIN",He smashed up my pod in the last race.,870669
WATTO,"QUI-GON, ANAKIN",It would take some long time to fx it.,870669
ANAKIN,"WATTO, QUI-GON",It wasn't my fault.,870670
ANAKIN,"WATTO, QUI-GON",Really.,870670
ANAKIN,"WATTO, QUI-GON",Sebulba flashed me with his vents.,870670
ANAKIN,"WATTO, QUI-GON","I actually saved the pod, mostly.",870671
WATTO,ANAKIN,That you did.,870672
WATTO,QUI-GON,The boy's good.,870673
WATTO,QUI-GON,"No doubts there, huh?",870673
QUI-GON,WATTO,I have acquired a pod in a game of chance.,870674
QUI-GON,WATTO,The fastest ever built.,870674
WATTO,QUI-GON,"I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it, huh?",870675
WATTO,QUI-GON,"So, you supply the pod and the entry fee.",870676
WATTO,QUI-GON,and I supply the boy.,870677
WATTO,QUI-GON,"We split the winnings 50-50, I think, huh?",870678
QUI-GON,WATTO,If it's going to be 50-50.,870679
QUI-GON,WATTO,I suggest you front the cash for the entry.,870679
QUI-GON,WATTO,If we win.,870680
QUI-GON,WATTO,"you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need.",870681
QUI-GON,WATTO,"And if we lose, you keep my ship.",870682
QUI-GON,WATTO,"Either way, you win.",870683
WATTO,QUI-GON,Deal!,870684
WATTO,ANAKIN,"Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.",870685
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,"What if this plan fails, Master?",870686
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,We could be stuck here a very long time.,870687
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,"Well, it's too dangerous to call for help.",870688
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,and a ship without a power supply isn't going to get us anywhere.,870689
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,And.,870690
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,there's something about this boy.,870691
QUI-GON,SHMI,You should be very proud of your son.,870692
QUI-GON,SHMI,He gives without any thought of reward.,870693
SHMI,QUI-GON,"Well, he knows nothing of greed.",870694
SHMI,QUI-GON,He has.,870695
QUI-GON,SHMI,He has special powers.,870695
SHMI,QUI-GON,Yes.,870696
QUI-GON,SHMI,He can see things before they happen.,870697
QUI-GON,SHMI,That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes.,870698
QUI-GON,SHMI,It's a Jedi trait.,870699
SHMI,QUI-GON,He deserves better than a slave's life.,870700
QUI-GON,SHMI,"Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identifed him early.",870701
QUI-GON,SHMI,The Force is unusually strong with him.,870702
QUI-GON,SHMI,That much is clear.,870702
QUI-GON,SHMI,Who was his father?,870703
SHMI,QUI-GON,There was no father.,870704
SHMI,QUI-GON,"I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him.",870705
SHMI,QUI-GON,I can't explain what happened.,870706
SHMI,QUI-GON,Can you help him?,870707
QUI-GON,SHMI,I don't know.,870708
QUI-GON,SHMI,I didn't actually come here to free slaves.,870709
KITSTER,ANAKIN,Hi Ani!,870710
ANAKIN,KITSTER,Hi!,870711
KITSTER,ANAKIN,"Wow, a real astro droid!",870712
KITSTER,ANAKIN,How do you get so lucky?,870713
ANAKIN,KITSTER,That isn't the half of it.,870713
ANAKIN,KITSTER,I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.,870714
KITSTER,ANAKIN,What?,870714
KITSTER,ANAKIN,With this?,870715

KITSTER,ANAKIN,You don't even know if this thing's gonna run.,870730
ANAKIN,KITSTER,It will.,870731
QUI-GON,"KITSTER, ANAKIN",I think it's time we found out.,870731
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,"Here, use this power charge.",870732
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,"Yes, sir!",870732

QUI-GON,ANAKIN,Most of them.,870743
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,Has anyone been to 'em all?,870744
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,Not likely.,870745
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,I wanna be the frst one to see 'em all.,870746

QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,I need an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.,870754
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,Wait a minute.,870755
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,I need a midi-chlorian count.,870756
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,The reading is off the chart.,870757
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,"Over 20,000.",870758
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high.,870759
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,No Jedi has.,870760
OBI-WAN,QUI-GON,What does that mean?,870761
QUI-GON,OBI-WAN,I'm not sure.,870762
WATTO,QUI-GON,I wanna see your spaceship the moment the race is over.,870763
QUI-GON,WATTO,"Patience, my blue friend.",870764
QUI-GON,WATTO,You'll have your winnings before the suns set.,870764
QUI-GON,WATTO,And we'll be far away from here.,870765
WATTO,QUI-GON,"Not if your ship belongs to me, I think, huh?",870766
WATTO,QUI-GON,"I warn you, no funny business.",870767
QUI-GON,WATTO,You don't think Anakin can win?,870768
WATTO,QUI-GON,Don't get me wrongo.,870768
WATTO,QUI-GON,I have great faith in the boy.,870769
WATTO,QUI-GON,He's a credit to your race.,870770
WATTO,QUI-GON,"but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.",870771
JAR JAR,QUI-GON,"Oh, no!",870772
QUI-GON,WATTO,Why do you think that?,870773
WATTO,QUI-GON,He always wins!,870774
WATTO,QUI-GON,I am betting heavily on Sebulba.,870775
QUI-GON,WATTO,I'll take that bet.,870776
WATTO,QUI-GON,You What?,870776
QUI-GON,WATTO,"I'll wager my new racing pod against, say.",870777
QUI-GON,WATTO,the boy and his mother.,870778
WATTO,QUI-GON,"No pod is worth two slaves, not by a long shot.",870779
QUI-GON,WATTO,"The boy, then.",870780
WATTO,QUI-GON,"Well, we'll let fate decide, huh?",870780
WATTO,QUI-GON,I just happen to have a chance cube here.,870783

WATTO,QUI-GON,"You won this small toss, outlander.",870786
WATTO,QUI-GON,but you won't win the race!,870786
WATTO,QUI-GON,So it makes little difference!,870787
WATTO,ANAKIN,Better stop your friend's betting or I'll end up owning him too.,870788
ANAKIN,QUI-GON,What'd he mean by that?,870789
QUI-GON,ANAKIN,I'll tell you later.,870789
QUI-GON,SHMI,Good morning.,870790
THREEPIO,R2D2,"Oh, my.",870791
THREEPIO,R2D2,Space travel sounds rather perilous.,870792
THREEPIO,R2D2,"I can assure you, they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships.",870793
KITSTER,ANAKIN,"This is so wizard, Ani.",870794
