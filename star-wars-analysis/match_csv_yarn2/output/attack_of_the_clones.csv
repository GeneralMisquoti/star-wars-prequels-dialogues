MACE WINDU,PADME,"Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, in the moons of Naboo.",873783

ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,Protection is a job for local security.,873842
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,not Jedi.,873842
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"It's overkill, Master.",873843
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,Investigation is implied in our mandate.,873843

OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Any activity up here?,873869
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,Quiet as a tomb.,873869
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.,873870
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,What's going on?,873871
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,She covered the cameras.,873871
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,I don't think she liked me watching her.,873872
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,What is she thinking?,873873
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,She programmed Artoo to warn us if there's an intruder.,873874
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,There are many other ways to kill a Senator.,873875
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"I know, but we also want to catch this assassin.",873876
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"Don't we, Master?",873876
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,You're using her as bait?,873877
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,It was her idea.,873878
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"Don't worry, no harm will come to her.",873879
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,I can sense everything going on in that room.,873880
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,Trust me.,873881
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,It's too risky.,873882
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"besides, your senses aren't that attuned, my young apprentice.",873883
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,And yours are?,873884
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Possibly.,873885

ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,I don't know why I keep dreaming bbout her.,873889
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Dreams pass in time.,873890
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,I'd much rather dream about Padme.,873891
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,Just being around her again is.,873892
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,intoxicating.,873892
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you.",873893
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,You've made a commitment to the Jedi order.,873894
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,a commitment not easily broken.,873895
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,and don't forget she's a politician and they're not to be trusted.,873896
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"She's not like the others in the Senate, Master.",873897
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,It's been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns.,873899
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,and they are in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy in order to get those funds.,873900
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"Not another lecture, Master.",873901
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,At least not on the economics of politics.,873902
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"And besides, you're generalizing.",873903
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.,873904
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"Palpatine is a politician, I have observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators.",873905
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,I think he's a good man.,873908
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,My-.,873908
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"I sense it, too.",873909
ANAKIN,PADME,Stay here!,873910
DORME,PADME,"Are you all right, m'lady?",873911
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,What took you so long?,873914
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder that I really liked,",873914
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,There he is,873915
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,with an open cockpit.,873916
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,and with the right speed capabilities.,873916
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,If you spent as much time practicing your saber techniques as you do on your wit you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.,873918
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,I thought I already did.,873919
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.",873920
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"Pull up, Anakin.",873921
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Pull up!,873921
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,You know I don't like it when you do that.,873922
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"Sorry, Master, I forgot you don't like flying.",873923
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,I don't mind flying.,873924
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,but what you're doing is suicide!,873924
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Anakin!,873925
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,How many times have I told you stay away from power couplings!,873926
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,That was good.,873927
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Where are you going?,873928
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,He went that way.,873928
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep's gonna end up deep fried.",873930
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"Personally, I'd very much like to find out who he is and who he's working for.",873931
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,This is a shortcut.,873932
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,I think.,873932
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"Well, you've lost him.",873933
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"I'm deeply sorry, Master.",873934
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"That was some shortcut, Anakin.",873935
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,He went completely the other way.,873936
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Once again you've proved.,873937
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,If you'll excuse me.,873937
OBI-WAN,OBI-WAN,I hate it when he does that.,873938
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Anakin!,873939
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"She went into the club, Master.",873940
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Patience.,873940
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Use the Force.,873941
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Think.,873941
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"Sorry, Master.",873941
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"He went in there to hide, not to run.",873942
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"Yes, Master.",873942
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"Next time, try not to lose it.",873943
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"Yes, Master.",873943
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,This weapon is your life.,873944
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"I try, Master.",873944
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the death of me?,873945
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,Don't say that Master.,873946
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,You're the closest thing I have to a father.,873947
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Then why don't you listen to me?,873948
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,I am trying,873949
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Can you see him?,873950
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,I think he is a she.,873951
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,And I think she is a changeling.,873952
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"In that case, extra careful.",873953
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Go and find her.,873954
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"Where are you going, Master?",873954

MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,And don't use registered transport.,873976
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,Travel as refugees.,873977
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,"As the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult.",873978

YODA,ANAKIN,Until caught this killer is.,873980
YODA,ANAKIN,our judgment she must respect.,873981

OBI-WAN,"YODA, MACE WINDU",I am concerned for my Padawan.,873999
OBI-WAN,"YODA, MACE WINDU",He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet.,874000

OBI-WAN,"YODA, MACE WINDU","But he still has much to learn, Master.",874003

ANAKIN,PADME,but he feels that I'm too unpredictable.,874038
ANAKIN,PADME,He won't let me move on.,874039

ANAKIN,PADME,It's worse.,874040
ANAKIN,PADME,He's overly critical.,874041
ANAKIN,PADME,He never listens.,874041

DORME,"PADME, CAPTAIN TYPHO",He'll be safe with me.,874057
PADME,DORME,You'll be fine.,874058
DORME,PADME,"It's not me, m'lady.",874059
DORME,PADME,I worry about you.,874059
DORME,PADME,What if they realize you've left the capital?,874060
PADME,DORME,"Well, then my Jedi protector will have to prove how good he is.",874061
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Anakin.,874062
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Don't do anything without first consulting either myself or the council.,874063
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"Yes, Master.",874064
OBI-WAN,PADME,"I'll get to the bottom of this plot quickly, milady.",874065
OBI-WAN,PADME,You'll be back here in no time.,874066
PADME,OBI-WAN,"I'll be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.",874067
ANAKIN,PADME,It's time to go.,874068
PADME,ANAKIN,I know.,874068
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"Anakin, may the Force be with you.",874069
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"May the Force be with you, Master.",874070
PADME,ANAKIN,Suddenly I'm afraid.,874071
ANAKIN,PADME,This is my first assignment on my own.,874072
ANAKIN,PADME,I am too.,874072
ANAKIN,PADME,Don't worry.,874073
ANAKIN,PADME,We have Artoo with us.,874073
OBI-WAN,CAPTAIN TYPHO,I do hope he doesn't try anything foolish.,874074
CAPTAIN TYPHO,OBI-WAN,I'd be more concerned about her doing something than him.,874075
HERMIONE,DEXTER JETTSTER,"Someone to see ya, honey Jedi, by the looks of him.",874077
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,Obi-wan!,874078
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,"Hello, Dex.",874079
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,Take a seat!,874080
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,I'll be right with ya!,874080
HERMIONE,OBI-WAN,You want a cup of jawa juice?,874081
OBI-WAN,HERMIONE,"Oh, yes.",874081
OBI-WAN,HERMIONE,Thank you.,874081
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,"Hey, ol' buddy!",874082
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,"So, my friend.",874083
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,What can I do for ya?,874083
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,You can tell me what this is.,874084
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,"Well, whattaya know.",874085
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,I ain't seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the Outer Rim!,874086
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,Can you tell me where it came from?,874088
OBI-WAN,HERMIONE,Thank you.,874090
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,This baby belongs to them cloners.,874105
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,What you got here is a Kamino saberdart.,874113
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,I wonder why it didn't show up in the analysis archive.,874115
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,It's these funny little cuts on the side that give it away.,874116
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,"Those analysis droids only focus on symbols, I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom.",874122
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,"Well, if droids could think there'd be none of us here, would there?",874122
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,Kamino.,874124
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,I'm not familiar with it.,874126
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,Is it in the Republic?,874126
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,"No, no, it's beyond the Outer Rim.",874126
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,"I'd say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze Should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archives.",874126
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,These Kaminoans keep to themselves.,874126
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,They're cloners.,874126
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,"Damned good ones, too.",874128
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,Cloners?,874128
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,Are they friendly?,874128
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,"oh, depends.",874129
OBI-WAN,DEXTER JETTSTER,"Depends on what, Dex?",874129
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,On how good your manners are.,874129
DEXTER JETTSTER,OBI-WAN,and how big your pocketbook is.,874129
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,Did you call for assistance?,874132
OBI-WAN,JOCASTA NU,Yes.,874150
OBI-WAN,JOCASTA NU,"yes, I did.",874152
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,"Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?",874163
OBI-WAN,JOCASTA NU,"Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system called Kamino.",874168
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,Kamino?,874180
OBI-WAN,JOCASTA NU,It doesn't show up on the archive charts.,874186
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,Kamino.,874188
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,It's not a system I'm familiar with.,874193
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,Are you sure you have the right coordinates?,874193
OBI-WAN,JOCASTA NU,"According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here.",874193
OBI-WAN,JOCASTA NU,just south of the Rishi Maze.,874197
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,"I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for.",874198
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,doesn't exist.,874202
OBI-WAN,JOCASTA NU,Impossible.,874202
OBI-WAN,JOCASTA NU,Perhaps the archives are incomplete.,874206
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,If an item does not appear in our records.,874206
JOCASTA NU,OBI-WAN,it does not exist.,874206
FOOD SERVER,R2D2,Hey you!,874206

PADME,ANAKIN,"Must be difficult, having sworn your life to the Jedi.",874215
PADME,ANAKIN,not being able to visit the places you like or do the things you like.,874216
ANAKIN,PADME,Or be with the people that I love.,874216
PADME,ANAKIN,Are you allowed to love?,874218
PADME,ANAKIN,I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.,874229
ANAKIN,PADME,Attachment is forbidden.,874229
ANAKIN,PADME,Possession is forbidden.,874235
ANAKIN,PADME,"Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love.",874236
ANAKIN,PADME,is central to a Jedi's life.,874236
ANAKIN,PADME,So you might say that we are encouraged to love.,874246
PADME,ANAKIN,You've changed so much.,874261
ANAKIN,PADME,You haven't changed a bit.,874263
ANAKIN,ANAKIN,You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams.,874275
YODA,YOUNGLINGS,Reach out.,874279
YODA,YOUNGLINGS,Sense the Force around you.,874279

YODA,YOUNGLINGS,Younglings!,874279
YODA,YOUNGLINGS,A visitor we have.,874280
YOUNGLINGS,OBI-WAN,"Hello, Master Obi-Wan.",874280
OBI-WAN,YOUNGLINGS,Hello.,874280
OBI-WAN,YODA,"I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.",874295
YODA,OBI-WAN,"What help can I be, Obi-Wan?",874296
OBI-WAN,YODA,I'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend.,874298
OBI-WAN,YODA,"I trust him, but the systems don't show on the archive maps.",874310
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.,874314
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",How embarrassing.,874316
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",How embarrassing.,874316
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN","Liam, the shades.",874317
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",Gather round the map reader.,874317
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",Clear your minds.,874319
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will.,874320
OBI-WAN,YODA,It ought to be.,874321
OBI-WAN,YODA,here.,874330
OBI-WAN,YODA,but it isn't.,874330
OBI-WAN,YODA,Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot.,874332
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",Hmm.,874333
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",Gravity's silhouette remains.,874333
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",but the star and all the planets.,874337
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",disappeared they have.,874337
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",How can this be?,874345
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",Hmm?,874345
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",A thought?,874345
YODA,"YOUNGLINGS, OBI-WAN",Anyone.,874345
BOY,YODA,Master?,874348
BOY,YODA,Because someone erased it from the archive memory.,874348
YODA,OBI-WAN,Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.,874348
YODA,OBI-WAN,The Padawan is right.,874348
YODA,OBI-WAN,Go to the center of gravity's pull.,874348
YODA,OBI-WAN,and find your planet you will.,874350
YODA,OBI-WAN,The data must have been erased.,874352
OBI-WAN,YODA,"But, Master Yoda, who could empty information from the archives?",874353
OBI-WAN,YODA,"That's impossible, isn't it?",874358
YODA,OBI-WAN,Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is.,874360
YODA,OBI-WAN,Only a Jedi could have erased those files.,874362
YODA,OBI-WAN,"But who and why, harder to answer.",874364
YODA,OBI-WAN,Meditate on this I will.,874372
PADME,ANAKIN,I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected.,874377
PADME,ANAKIN,"but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough.",874381
PADME,ANAKIN,I'm not sure I was ready.,874382
ANAKIN,PADME,The people you served thought you did a good job.,874383
ANAKIN,PADME,I heard they even tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office.,874384
PADME,ANAKIN,I was relieved when my two terms were up.,874386
PADME,ANAKIN,But when the queen asked me to serve as senator.,874388
PADME,ANAKIN,I couldn't refuse her.,874398
ANAKIN,PADME,I agree with her.,874398
ANAKIN,PADME,I think the Republic needs you.,874400
ANAKIN,PADME,I'm glad that you chose to serve.,874406
PADME,"SIO BIBBLE, QUEEN JAMILLIA",If the senate votes to create an army.,874406
PADME,"SIO BIBBLE, QUEEN JAMILLIA",I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.,874406
SIO BIBBLE,PADME,It's unthinkable.,874406
SIO BIBBLE,PADME,There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic.,874409
QUEEN JAMILLIA,PADME,Do you see any way through negotiations.,874416
QUEEN JAMILLIA,PADME,to bring the separatists back into the Republic?,874426
PADME,QUEEN JAMILLIA,Not if they feel threatened.,874435
PADME,QUEEN JAMILLIA,My guess is they'll turn to the Trade Federations or the Commerce Guilds for help.,874437
SIO BIBBLE,"PADME, QUEEN JAMILLIA","It's outrageous, but after four trials in the Supreme Court.",874442
SIO BIBBLE,"PADME, QUEEN JAMILLIA",Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation.,874449
SIO BIBBLE,"PADME, QUEEN JAMILLIA",I fear the senate is powerless to resolve this crisis.,874449
QUEEN JAMILLIA,"PADME, SIO BIBBLE",We must keep our faith in the Republic.,874455
QUEEN JAMILLIA,PADME,The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.,874455
PADME,QUEEN JAMILLIA,Let's pray that day never comes.,874459
QUEEN JAMILLIA,PADME,"In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.",874459
SIO BIBBLE,ANAKIN,"What is your suggestion,",874459
SIO BIBBILE,ANAKIN,Master Jedi?,874460
PADME,SIO BIBBILE,"Oh, Anakin's not a Jedi yet.",874460
PADME,SIO BIBBILE,He's still a Padawan learner.,874461
PADME,QUEEN JAMILLIA,But I was thinking--,874463
ANAKIN,PADME,Hold on a minute.,874464
PADME,ANAKIN,Excuse me.,874464
PADME,QUEEN JAMILLIA,I was thinking I would stay in the lake country.,874466
PADME,QUEEN JAMILLIA,There are some places up there that are very isolated.,874466
ANAKIN,PADME,Excuse me.,874467
ANAKIN,PADME,"I'm in charge of security here, milady.",874467
PADME,ANAKIN,And this is my home.,874471
PADME,ANAKIN,I know it very well.,874474
PADME,ANAKIN,That is why we're here.,874480
PADME,ANAKIN,I think it would be wise if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance.,874482
ANAKIN,PADME,"Sorry, milady.",874483
QUEEN JAMILLIA,PADME,Perfect.,874483
QUEEN JAMILLIA,PADME,"It's settled, then.",874483
OBI-WAN,R4,"There it is, R4, right where it should be.",874483
OBI-WAN,R4,Our missing planet Kamino.,874483
TAUN WE,OBI-WAN,Master Jedi.,874487
TAUN WE,OBI-WAN,The prime minister is expecting you.,874490
OBI-WAN,TAUN WE,I'm expected?,874491
TAUN WE,OBI-WAN,Of course.,874491
TAUN WE,OBI-WAN,He is anxious to meet you.,874491
TAUN WE,OBI-WAN,After all these years.,874491
TAUN WE,OBI-WAN,we were beginning to think you weren't coming.,874492
TAUN WE,OBI-WAN,"Now, please, this way.",874493
TAUN WE,"LAMA SU, OBI-WAN",May I present Lama Su.,874493
TAUN WE,"LAMA SU, OBI-WAN",prime minister of Kamino.,874493
TAUN WE,"LAMA SU, OBI-WAN",And this is Master Jedi--.,874494
OBI-WAN,"LAMA SU, TAUN WE",Obi-Wan Kenobi.,874503
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,I trust you're going to enjoy your stay.,874503
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,Please.,874503
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,And now to business.,874503
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule.,874503
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,"200,000 units are ready.",874503
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,with a million more well on the way.,874503
OBI-WAN,"LAMA SU, TAUN WE",That's good news.,874503
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas.,874503
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,that his order will be met on time.,874503
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,I'm sorry.,874503
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,Master--.,874503
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still a leading member of the Jedi Council.,874503
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,is he not?,874506
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,Master Sifo-Dyas was killed almost ten years ago.,874506
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.",874508
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,But I'm sure he would have been proud of the army we've built for him.,874510
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,The army?,874511
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,Yes.,874526
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,"A clone army, and I must say, one of the finest we've ever created.",874527
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,"Tell me, Prime Minister.",874527
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,when my master first contacted you about the army.,874530
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,did he say who it was for?,874533
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,Of course he did.,874533
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,This army is for the Republic.,874533
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.,874534
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,That's why I'm here.,874542
PADME,ANAKIN,We used to come here for school retreat.,874542
PADME,ANAKIN,We would swim to that island every day.,874542
PADME,ANAKIN,I love the water.,874542
PADME,ANAKIN,We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us.,874548
PADME,ANAKIN,and try to guess the names of the birds singing.,874548
ANAKIN,PADME,I don't like sand.,874549
ANAKIN,PADME,It's coarse and rough and irritating.,874550
ANAKIN,PADME,and it gets everywhere.,874553
ANAKIN,PADME,Not like here.,874553
ANAKIN,PADME,"Here, everything is soft.",874578
ANAKIN,PADME,and smooth.,874589
PADME,ANAKIN,No.,874592
PADME,ANAKIN,I shouldn't have done that.,874598
ANAKIN,PADME,I'm sorry.,874614
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,Very impressive.,874614
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,I'd hoped you would be pleased.,874620
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,Clones can think creatively.,874623
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,You will find that they are immensely superior to droids.,874637
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,We take great pride in our combat education and training programs.,874639
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,This group was created about five years ago.,874641
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,You mentioned growth acceleration.,874642
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,"Oh,yes, it's essential.",874643
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,"Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow.",874644
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,Now we can do it in half the time.,874644
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,I see.,874645
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,They are totally obedient.,874647
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,taking any order without question.,874647
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,We modified their genetic structure.,874649
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,to make them less independent than the original host.,874649
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,And who was the original host?,874650
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.,874655
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,And where is this bounty hunter now?,874655
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,"Oh, we keep him here.",874657
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,"Apart from his pay, which is considerable.",874658
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,Fett demanded only one thing: an unaltered clone for himself.,874659
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,"Curious, isn't it?",874660
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,Unaltered?,874669
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,Pure genetic replication.,874670
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,No tampering with the structure to make it more docile.,874670
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,and no growth acceleration.,874670
OBI-WAN,LAMA SU,I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett.,874670
TAUN WE,OBI-WAN,I would be very happy to arrange it.,874670
LAMA SU,OBI-WAN,"Magnificent, aren't they?",874670
PADME,ANAKIN,I don't know.,874675
ANAKIN,PADME,Sure you do.,874675
ANAKIN,PADME,You just don't want to tell me.,874677
PADME,ANAKIN,You gonna use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?,874677
ANAKIN,PADME,They only work on the weak-minded.,874677
PADME,ANAKIN,All right.,874677
PADME,ANAKIN,I was twelve.,874685
PADME,ANAKIN,His name was Palo.,874689
PADME,ANAKIN,We were both in the Legislative Youth Program.,874694
PADME,ANAKIN,He was a few years older than I.,874695
PADME,ANAKIN,Very cute.,874695
PADME,ANAKIN,"Dark, curly hair.",874695
PADME,ANAKIN,Dreamy eyes.,874697
ANAKIN,PADME,"All right, I get the picture.",874697
ANAKIN,PADME,Whatever happened to him?,874698
PADME,ANAKIN,I went into public service; he went on to become an artist.,874700
ANAKIN,PADME,Maybe he was the smart one.,874702
PADME,ANAKIN,"You really don't like politicians, do you?",874702
ANAKIN,PADME,I like two or three.,874702
ANAKIN,PADME,but I'm not really sure about one of them.,874704
ANAKIN,PADME,I don't think the system works.,874706
PADME,ANAKIN,How would you have it work?,874711
ANAKIN,PADME,We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem.,874715
ANAKIN,PADME,"agree what's in the best interest of all the people, and then do it.",874716
PADME,ANAKIN,That's exactly what we do.,874719
PADME,ANAKIN,The trouble is that people don't always agree.,874725
ANAKIN,PADME,"Well, then they should be made to.",874728
PADME,ANAKIN,By whom?,874728
PADME,ANAKIN,Who's gonna make them?,874728
ANAKIN,PADME,I don't know.,874728
ANAKIN,PADME,Someone.,874729
PADME,ANAKIN,You?,874730
ANAKIN,PADME,Of course not me.,874733
PADME,ANAKIN,But someone.,874738
ANAKIN,PADME,Someone wise.,874739
PADME,ANAKIN,Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.,874739
ANAKIN,PADME,"Well, if it works.",874739
PADME,ANAKIN,You're making fun of me.,874739
ANAKIN,PADME,No.,874740
ANAKIN,PADME,I'd be much too frightened to tease a senator.,874740
ANAKIN,NA,"Whoa, whoa.",874740
ANAKIN,NA,"Oh, whoa!",874740
PADME,ANAKIN,Ani!,874741
PADME,ANAKIN,"Ani, are you all right?",874744
TAUN WE,BOBA FETT,"Boba, is your father here?",874751
BOBA FETT,TAUN WE,Yep.,874764
TAUN WE,BOBA FETT,May we see him?,874764
BOBA FETT,TAUN WE,Sure.,874764
BOBA FETT,JANGO FETT,"Dad, Taun We's here.",874764
TAUN WE,JANGO FETT,"Jango, welcome back.",874766
TAUN WE,JANGO FETT,Was your trip productive?,874769
JANGO FETT,TAUN WE,Fairly.,874771
TAUN WE,JANGO FETT,This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.,874771
TAUN WE,JANGO FETT,He's come to check on our progress.,874772
OBI-WAN,JANGO FETT,Your clones are very impressive.,874772
OBI-WAN,JANGO FETT,You must be very proud.,874772
JANGO FETT,OBI-WAN,I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe.,874772
OBI-WAN,JANGO FETT,Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?,874772
JANGO FETT,OBI-WAN,Once or twice.,874774
OBI-WAN,JANGO FETT,Recently?,874774
JANGO FETT,OBI-WAN,Possibly.,874776
OBI-WAN,JANGO FETT,Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas.,874778
JANGO FETT,BOBA FETT,"Boba, rood eht so-heeck.",874780
JANGO FETT,OBI-WAN,Master who?,874787
