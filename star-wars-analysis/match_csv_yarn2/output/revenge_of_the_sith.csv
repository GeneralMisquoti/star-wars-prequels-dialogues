ANAKIN,PADME,"I know, I know.",876132
PADME,ANAKIN,Do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?,876133
ANAKIN,PADME,We don't need his help.,876134
ANAKIN,PADME,Our baby is a blessing.,876135
YODA,ANAKIN,Premonitions.,876136
YODA,ANAKIN,premonitions.,876136
YODA,ANAKIN,Hm.,876136
YODA,ANAKIN,these visions you have.,876137
ANAKIN,YODA,"They are of pain, suffering, death.",876138
YODA,ANAKIN,"Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?",876140
ANAKIN,YODA,Someone.,876141
YODA,ANAKIN,close to you?,876142
ANAKIN,YODA,Yes.,876143
YODA,ANAKIN,"Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin.",876144
YODA,ANAKIN,The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.,876145
ANAKIN,YODA,"I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.",876146
YODA,ANAKIN,Death is a natural part of life.,876147
YODA,ANAKIN,Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force.,876148

YODA,ANAKIN,"Miss them, do not.",876149
YODA,ANAKIN,Attachment leads to jealousy.,876150
YODA,ANAKIN,"The shadow of greed, that is.",876151
ANAKIN,YODA,"What must I do, Master Yoda?",876152
YODA,ANAKIN,Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.,876154
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.,876155
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"I'm sorry, I was held up.",876156
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,I have no excuse.,876157
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"In short, they are going very well.",876157
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.",876158
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,What's wrong then?,876159
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.,876161
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action.",876162
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,Is that bad?,876162
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,It will make it easier for us to end this war.,876163
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Be careful of your friend Palpatine.,876164
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,Be careful of what?,876165
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,He has requested your presence.,876166
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,What for?,876166
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,He would not say.,876167
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,He didn't inform the Council?,876167
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"That's unusual, isn't it?",876168
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy.",876169
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"I hope you trust me, Anakin.",876170
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,Of course.,876171
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"I need your help, son.",876172

PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"To be the eyes, ears and voice of the Republic.",876175
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,Anakin.,876176
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.,876177
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,Me?,876178
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,A Master?,876178
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,"I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members.",876180
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,They'll never accept this.,876180
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,I think they will.,876181
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,they need you more than you know.,876182
YODA,ANAKIN,"Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not.",876183
YODA,ANAKIN,Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.,876184
ANAKIN,YODA,I understand.,876185
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,"You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.",876186
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,What?,876187
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,How can you do this?,876188
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,"This is outrageous, it's unfair.",876188
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?,876190
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,"Take a seat, young Skywalker.",876191
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,"Forgive me, Master.",876192
KI-ADI-MUNDI,GROUP,"We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, but have found no sign of General Grievous.",876194

YODA,KI-ADI-MUNDI,"The outlying systems, you must sweep.",876196
OBI-WAN,YODA,We do not have many ships to spare.,876197
KI-ADI-MUNDI,YODA,What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?,876198
MACE WINDU,YODA,"It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!",876199
OBI-WAN,YODA,"He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose.",876200
YODA,MACE WINDU,"Go, I will.",876201
YODA,MACE WINDU,"Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.",876202
MACE WINDU,"YODA, KI-ADI-MUNDI, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN",It is settled then.,876203
MACE WINDU,"YODA, KI-ADI-MUNDI, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN",Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.,876204
MACE WINDU,"YODA, KI-ADI-MUNDI, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN",May the Force be with us all.,876205
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!",876206
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,That's never been done in the history of the Jedi.,876208
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,It's insulting!,876208
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"Calm down, Anakin.",876209
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,You have been given a great honor.,876209
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,To be on the Council at your age.,876210
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,It's never happened before.,876210
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor.,876211
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.,876212
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council.",876213
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,But it's what you wanted!,876213
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.,876214
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,That has nothing to do with this.,876215
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,The only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.,876216
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,And?,876218
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"Anakin, I am on your side.",876218
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,I didn't want to put you in this situation.,876219
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,What situation?,876219
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings.,876220
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,They want to know what he's up to.,876221
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,They want me to spy on the Chancellor?,876222
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,That's treason!,876223
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"We are at war, Anakin.",876223
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?,876224
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,This assignment is not to be on record.,876225
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,"The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.",876226
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,He befriended me.,876227
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.,876227
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,That is why you must help us.,876228
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"Anakin, our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.",876230
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,The Senate demanded that he stay longer.,876231
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,"Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.",876232
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,Something is out of place.,876232
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code.,876233
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,Against the Republic.,876234
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,Against a mentor.,876234
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,and a friend.,876234
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,That's what's out of place here.,876235
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,Why are you asking this of me?,876235
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,The Council is asking you.,876236
OBI-WAN,"MACE WINDU, YODA",Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.,876237
MACE WINDU,OBI-WAN,"It's very dangerous, putting them together.",876238
MACE WINDU,OBI-WAN,I don't think the boy can handle it.,876239
MACE WINDU,OBI-WAN,I don't trust him.,876240
OBI-WAN,MACE WINDU,"With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One?",876241
OBI-WAN,MACE WINDU,Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?,876242
MACE WINDU,OBI-WAN,So the prophecy says.,876243
YODA,"OBI-WAN, MACE WINDU",A prophecy.,876244
YODA,"OBI-WAN, MACE WINDU",that misread could have been.,876244
OBI-WAN,YODA,He will not let me down.,876245
OBI-WAN,YODA,He never has.,876246
YODA,OBI-WAN,I hope right you are.,876247
ANAKIN,PADME,"Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order.",876248
ANAKIN,PADME,I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.,876249
PADME,ANAKIN,Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?,876250
ANAKIN,PADME,What do you mean?,876251
PADME,ANAKIN,"What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?",876253
ANAKIN,PADME,I don't believe that.,876254
ANAKIN,PADME,And you're sounding like a Separatist!,876255
PADME,ANAKIN,This war represents a failure to listen.,876256
PADME,ANAKIN,"Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone.",876257
PADME,ANAKIN,"Please, ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.",876258
ANAKIN,PADME,Don't ask me to do that.,876259
ANAKIN,PADME,"Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs.",876260
PADME,ANAKIN,What is it?,876261
ANAKIN,PADME,Nothing.,876261
PADME,ANAKIN,Don't do this.,876262
PADME,ANAKIN,don't shut me out.,876262
PADME,ANAKIN,Let me help you.,876262
PADME,ANAKIN,Hold me.,876263
PADME,ANAKIN,"like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago.",876264
PADME,ANAKIN,when there was nothing but our love.,876265
PADME,ANAKIN,"No politics, no plotting.",876266
PADME,ANAKIN,no war.,876266
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,"You wanted to see me, Chancellor.",876267
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"Yes, Anakin!",876267
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,Come closer.,876267
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,I have good news.,876268
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous.,876269
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,He's hiding in the Utapau system.,876270
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,"At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.",876272
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment.,876273
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"You are the best choice, by far.",876275
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"Sit down,",876275
PALPATINE,NA,Leave us.,876277
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council.",876279
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.",876280
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,I'm not sure I understand.,876281
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,You must sense what I have come to suspect.,876282
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,the Jedi Council want control of the Republic.,876283
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,they're planning to betray me.,876284
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,I don't think.,876285
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"Anakin, search your feelings.",876286
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"You know, don't you?",876287
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,I know they don't trust you.,876288
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,Or the Senate.,876288
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,or the Republic.,876288
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,or democracy for that matter.,876289
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.,876290
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,Why?,876291
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?",876293
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?",876294
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,I don't uh.,876295
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,I don't know what to say.,876296

PALPATINE,ANAKIN,""" Even the Jedi.",876299
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,The Jedi use their power for good.,876299

ANAKIN,PALPATINE,The Sith rely on their passion for their strength.,876303
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,"They think inwards, only about themselves.",876304
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,And the Jedi don't?,876305
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,The Jedi are selfless.,876306
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,they only care about others.,876306
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?,876308
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,No.,876309
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,I thought not.,876309
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.,876310
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,It's a Sith legend.,876311
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life.",876314
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.,876316
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,He could actually save people from death?,876319
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.,876321
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,What happened to him?,876322
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,He became so powerful.,876323
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.",876324
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.",876327
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,"It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.",876331
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,Is it possible to learn this power?,876332
