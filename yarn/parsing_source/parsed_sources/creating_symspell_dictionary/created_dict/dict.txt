2873749;;senator, we're making our final approach into coruscant.;;1
2873752;;i guess i was wrong.;;1
2873753;;there was no danger at all.;;1
2873755;;milady, i'm so sorry.;;1
2873756;;i've failed you, senator.;;1
2873758;;milady, you're still in danger here.;;1
2873759;;- i shouldn't have come back. - this vote is very important.;;1
2873760;;you did your duty. corde did hers. now, come.;;1
2873762;;i don't know how much longer i can hold off the vote, my friends.;;1
2873763;;more and more star systems are joining the separatists.;;1
2873764;;if they do break away...;;1
2873765;;i will not let this republic that has stood for a thousand years...;;1
2873766;;be split in two.;;1
2873767;;my negotiations will not fail.;;1
2873768;;if they do, you must realize...;;1
2873769;;there aren't enough jedi to protect the republic.;;1
2873770;;we're keepers of the peace, not soldiers.;;1
2873772;;do you think it will really come to war?;;1
2873773;;the dark side clouds everything.;;1
2873774;;impossible to see the future is.;;1
2873775;;the loyalist committee has arrived, your honor.;;1
2873778;;we will discuss this matter later.;;1
2873779;;senator amidala, your tragedy on the landing platform...;;1
2873781;;seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart.;;1
2873782;;do you have any idea who was behind this attack?;;1
2873783;;our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of naboo.;;1
2873784;;i think that count dooku was behind it.;;1
2873785;;he is a political idealist, not a murderer.;;1
2873786;;you know, milady, count dooku was once a jedi.;;1
2873787;;he couldn't assassinate anyone. it's not in his character.;;1
2873788;;but for certain, senator...;;1
2873789;;in grave danger you are.;;1
2873790;;masterjedi, may i suggest...;;1
2873791;;the senator be placed under the protection of your graces?;;1
2873792;;do you really think that's a wise decision under these stressful times?;;1
2873793;;chancellor, if i may comment, i do not believe...;;1
2873794;;the situation is that serious?;;1
2873795;;no, but i do, senator.;;1
2873796;;i realize all too well that additional security...;;1
2873797;;might be disruptive for you...;;1
2873798;;but perhaps someone you're familiar with.;;1
2873799;;an old friend, like master kenobi.;;1
2873801;;he's just returned from a border dispute on ansion.;;1
2873802;;do it for me, milady. please?;;1
2873803;;the thought of losing you...;;1
2873805;;i will have obi-wan report to you immediately, milady.;;1
2873806;;thank you, master windu.;;1
2873807;;- you seem a little on edge. - not at all.;;1
2873808;;i haven't felt you this tense since we fell into that nest of gundarks.;;1
2873809;;you fell into that nightmare, master...;;1
2873810;;and i rescued you, remember?;;1
2873812;;you're sweating. relax. take a deep breath.;;1
2873813;;i haven't seen her in ten years, master.;;1
2873815;;- mesa so smilen to seein yousa! - good to see you again, jarjar.;;1
2873817;;mesa palos here! lookie, lookie, senator.;;1
2873819;;it's a great pleasure to see you again, milady.;;1
2873820;;it has been far too long, master kenobi.;;1
2873822;;- my goodness, you've grown. - so have you.;;1
2873823;;grown more beautiful, i mean.;;1
2873824;;well, for a senator, i mean.;;1
2873825;;ani, you'll always be that little boy i knew on tatooine.;;1
2873826;;our presence here will be invisible, milady, i can assure you.;;1
2873827;;i'm captain typho of her majesty's security service.;;1
2873828;;queen jamillia has been informed of your assignment.;;1
2873829;;i am grateful you are here, master kenobi.;;1
2873830;;the situation is more dangerous than the senator will admit.;;1
2873831;;i don't need more security. i need answers.;;1
2873832;;i want to know who's trying to kill me.;;1
2873833;;we are here to protect you, senator, not to start an investigation.;;1
2873834;;we will find out who's trying to kill you, padmé.;;1
2873836;;we will not exceed our mandate, my young padawan learner.;;1
2873837;;i meant that in the interest of protecting her, master, of course.;;1
2873838;;we will not go through this exercise again, anakin...;;1
2873839;;and you will pay attention to my lead.;;1
2873840;;- why? - what?;;1
2873841;;why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer?;;1
2873842;;protection is a job for local security, notjedi.;;1
2873843;;it's overkill, master. investigation is implied in our mandate.;;1
2873844;;we will do exactly as the council has instructed.;;1
2873845;;and you will learn your place, young one.;;1
2873846;;perhaps with merely your presence...;;1
2873847;;the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed.;;1
2873848;;now, if you'll excuse me...;;1
2873850;;i know i'll feel better having you here.;;1
2873851;;i'll have an officer stationed on every floor...;;1
2873852;;and i'll be in the control center downstairs.;;1
2873853;;mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, ani.;;1
2873854;;she hardly even recognized me, jarjar.;;1
2873855;;i've thought about her every day since we parted and...;;1
2873856;;she's forgotten me completely.;;1
2873858;;happier den mesa seein her in a longo time.;;1
2873859;;you're focusing on the negative, anakin. be mindful of your thoughts.;;1
2873860;;she was pleased to see us.;;1
2873861;;now, let's check the security.;;1
2873862;;i hit the ship, but they used a decoy.;;1
2873863;;we'll have to try something more subtle this time, zam.;;1
2873864;;my client is getting impatient.;;1
2873865;;take these. be careful. they're very poisonous.;;1
2873866;;and, zam, there can be no mistakes this time.;;1
2873867;;captain typho has more than enough men downstairs.;;1
2873868;;no assassin would try that way.;;1
2873869;;- any activity up here? - quiet as a tomb.;;1
2873870;;i don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.;;1
2873871;;- what's going on? - she covered the cameras.;;1
2873872;;i don't think she liked me watching her.;;1
2873873;;what is she thinking?;;1
2873874;;she programmed r2 to warn us if there is an intruder.;;1
2873875;;there are many other ways to kill a senator.;;1
2873876;;i know, but we also want to catch this assassin, don't we, master?;;1
2873877;;you're using her as bait.;;1
2873878;;it was her idea.;;1
2873879;;don't worry. no harm will come to her.;;1
2873880;;i can sense everything going on in that room.;;1
2873883;;besides, your senses aren't that attuned, my young apprentice.;;1
2873887;;i don't sleep well anymore.;;1
2873888;;because of your mother?;;1
2873889;;i don't know why i keep dreaming about her.;;1
2873890;;dreams pass in time.;;1
2873891;;i'd much rather dream about padmé.;;1
2873892;;just being around her again is... intoxicating.;;1
2873893;;be mindful of your thoughts, anakin. they betray you.;;1
2873894;;you've made a commitment to thejedi order...;;1
2873895;;a commitment not easily broken.;;1
2873896;;and don't forget, she's a politician. they're not to be trusted.;;1
2873897;;she's not like the others in the senate, master.;;1
2873898;;it is my experience that senators focus...;;1
2873899;;only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns...;;1
2873900;;and they're in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy...;;1
2873901;;- in order to get those funds. - not another lecture.;;1
2873902;;at least not on the economics of politics.;;1
2873903;;and besides, you're generalizing.;;1
2873904;;the chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.;;1
2873905;;palpatine is a politician.;;1
2873906;;i have observed that he is very clever...;;1
2873907;;in following the passions and the prejudices of the senators.;;1
2873908;;i think he's a good man...;;1
2873909;;i sense it too.;;1
2873911;;are you all right, milady?;;1
2873914;;- what took you so long? - oh, you know, master.;;1
2873915;;- i couldn't find a speeder i liked... - there he is.;;1
2873916;;with the open cockpit and the right speed capabilities.;;1
2873917;;if you spent as long practicing your saber techniques as you do your wit...;;1
2873918;;you would rival master yoda as a swordsman.;;1
2873919;;i thought i already did.;;1
2873920;;only in your mind, my very young apprentice.;;1
2873921;;pull up, anakin. pull up!;;1
2873922;;you know i don't like it when you do that.;;1
2873923;;sorry, master. i forgot you don't like flying.;;1
2873924;;i don't mind flying, but what you're doing is suicide!;;1
2873925;;anakin! how many times have i told you...;;1
2873926;;stay away from power couplings!;;1
2873928;;where are you going? he went that way.;;1
2873929;;master, if we keep this chase going any longer...;;1
2873930;;that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...;;1
2873931;;and, personally, i'd like to find out who he is and who he's working for.;;1
2873932;;this is a shortcut... i think.;;1
2873933;;well, you've lost him.;;1
2873934;;i'm deeply sorry, master.;;1
2873935;;that was some shortcut, anakin.;;1
2873936;;he went completely the other way.;;1
2873937;;- once again you've proved... - if you'll excuse me.;;1
2873938;;i hate it when he does that.;;1
2873940;;- she went into the club, master. - patience.;;1
2873941;;- use the force. think. - sorry, master.;;1
2873942;;- he went in there to hide, not to run. - yes, master.;;1
2873943;;- next time, try not to lose it. - yes, master.;;1
2873944;;- this weapon is your life. - i try, master.;;1
2873945;;why do i get the feeling you're going to be the death of me?;;1
2873946;;don't say that, master.;;1
2873947;;you're the closest thing i have to a father.;;1
2873948;;then why don't you listen to me?;;1
2873950;;can you see him?;;1
2873951;;i think he is a she...;;1
2873952;;and i think she is a changeling.;;1
2873953;;in that case, be extra careful.;;1
2873954;;- go and find her. - where are you going, master?;;1
2873957;;- you wanna buy some death sticks? - you don't want to sell me death sticks.;;1
2873958;;i don't want to sell you death sticks.;;1
2873959;;you want to go home and rethink your life.;;1
2873960;;i want to go home and rethink my life.;;1
2873962;;jedi business. go back to your drinks.;;1
2873963;;do you know who it was you were trying to kill?;;1
2873964;;it was a senator from naboo.;;1
2873965;;- and who hired you? - it was just a job.;;1
2873966;;who hired you? tell us.;;1
2873968;;it was a bounty hunter called...;;1
2873971;;track down this bounty hunter you must, obi-wan.;;1
2873972;;most importantly, find out who he's working for.;;1
2873973;;what about senator amidala? she will still need protecting.;;1
2873974;;handle that your padawan will.;;1
2873975;;anakin, escort the senator back to her home planet of naboo.;;1
2873976;;she'll be safer there. and don't use registered transport.;;1
2873978;;as the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult...;;1
2873979;;to get senator amidala to leave the capital.;;1
2873980;;until caught this killer is...;;1
2873981;;our judgment she must respect.;;1
2873982;;anakin, go to the senate...;;1
2873983;;and ask chancellor palpatine to speak with her about this matter.;;1
2873984;;i will talk with her.;;1
2873985;;senator amidala will not refuse an executive order.;;1
2873986;;i know her well enough to assure you of that.;;1
2873987;;thank you, your excellency.;;1
2873988;;and so, they've finally given you an assignment.;;1
2873989;;your patience has paid off.;;1
2873990;;your guidance more than my patience.;;1
2873991;;you don't need guidance, anakin.;;1
2873992;;in time, you will learn to trust your feelings.;;1
2873993;;then you will be invincible.;;1
2873994;;i have said it many times:;;1
2873995;;you are the most gifted jedi i have ever met.;;1
2873996;;thank you, your excellency.;;1
2873997;;i see you becoming the greatest of all thejedi, anakin...;;1
2873998;;even more powerful than master yoda.;;1
2873999;;i am concerned for my padawan.;;1
2874000;;he is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet.;;1
2874001;;the council is confident in its decision, obi-wan.;;1
2874002;;the boy has exceptional skills.;;1
2874003;;but he still has much to learn, master.;;1
2874004;;his abilities have made him, well, arrogant.;;1
2874006;;a flaw more and more common among jedi.;;1
2874007;;too sure of themselves they are.;;1
2874008;;even the older, more experienced ones.;;1
2874009;;remember, obi-wan, if the prophecy is true...;;1
2874010;;your apprentice is the only one who can bring the force back into balance.;;1
2874011;;i'm taking an extended leave of absence.;;1
2874012;;it will be your responsibility to take my place in the senate.;;1
2874013;;representative binks, i know i can count on you.;;1
2874014;;mesa honored to be taking on dissa heavy burden.;;1
2874015;;mesa accept this with muy, muy humility and...;;1
2874016;;jarjar, i don't wish to hold you up.;;1
2874017;;i'm sure you have a great deal to do.;;1
2874020;;i do not like this idea of hiding.;;1
2874022;;now that the council has ordered an investigation...;;1
2874023;;it won't take master obi-wan long to find this bounty hunter.;;1
2874024;;i haven't worked for a year to defeat the military creation act...;;1
2874025;;to not be here when its fate is decided.;;1
2874026;;sometimes we must let go of our pride...;;1
2874027;;and do what is requested of us.;;1
2874028;;anakin, you've grown up.;;1
2874029;;master obi-wan manages not to see it.;;1
2874030;;don't get me wrong.;;1
2874031;;obi-wan is a great mentor.;;1
2874032;;as wise as master yoda and...;;1
2874033;;as powerful as master windu.;;1
2874034;;i am truly thankful to be his apprentice.;;1
2874035;;in some ways... a lot of ways...;;1
2874036;;i'm really ahead of him.;;1
2874037;;i'm ready for the trials...;;1
2874038;;but he feels that i'm too unpredictable.;;1
2874039;;he won't let me move on.;;1
2874040;;- that must be frustrating. - it's worse.;;1
2874041;;he's overly critical. he never listens.;;1
2874044;;all mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like.;;1
2874045;;it's the only way we grow.;;1
2874048;;don't try to grow up too fast.;;1
2874049;;but i am grown up.;;1
2874050;;you said it yourself.;;1
2874051;;please don't look at me like that.;;1
2874053;;it makes me feel uncomfortable.;;1
2874055;;- be safe, milady. - thank you, captain.;;1
2874056;;take good care of dorme. the threat's on you two now.;;1
2874057;;he'll be safe with me.;;1
2874059;;it's not me, milady. i worry about you.;;1
2874060;;what if they realize you've left the capital?;;1
2874061;;well, then myjedi protector will have to prove how good he is.;;1
2874063;;don't do anything without first consulting either myself or the council.;;1
2874065;;i'll get to the bottom of this plot quickly, milady.;;1
2874066;;you'll be back here in no time.;;1
2874067;;i'll be most grateful for your speed, masterjedi.;;1
2874068;;- it's time to go. - i know.;;1
2874069;;anakin, may the force be with you.;;1
2874070;;may the force be with you, master.;;1
2874072;;this is my first assignment on my own. i am too.;;1
2874073;;don't worry. we have r2 with us.;;1
2874074;;i do hope he doesn't try anything foolish.;;1
2874075;;i'd be more concerned about her doing something than him.;;1
2874076;;someone to see ya, honey!;;1
2874077;;jedi, by the looks of him.;;1
2874080;;take a seat. i'll be right with ya.;;1
2874081;;- you wanna cup o'jawa juice? - oh, yes. thank you.;;1
2874083;;so, my friend, what can i do for ya?;;1
2874084;;you can tell me what this is.;;1
2874086;;i ain't seen one of these since i was prospectin'...;;1
2874087;;on subterrel, beyond the outer rim.;;1
2874088;;can you tell me where it came from?;;1
2874089;;this baby belongs to them cloners.;;1
2874090;;what you got here is a kamino saberdart.;;1
2874091;;i wonder why it didn't show up in the analysis archives.;;1
2874092;;it's these funny little cuts on the side that give it away.;;1
2874093;;those analysis droids only focus on symbols.;;1
2874094;;i should think that you jedi would have more respect...;;1
2874095;;for the difference between knowledge and...;;1
2874097;;well, if droids could think...;;1
2874098;;there'd be none of us here, would there?;;1
2874099;;kamino. i'm not familiar with it. is it in the republic?;;1
2874100;;no, no. it's beyond the outer rim.;;1
2874101;;i'd say about 12 parsecs outside the rishi maze.;;1
2874102;;should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archives.;;1
2874103;;these kaminoans keep to themselves.;;1
2874104;;they're cloners. damn good ones too.;;1
2874105;;- cloners. are they friendly? - depends.;;1
2874106;;depends on what, dex?;;1
2874107;;on how good your manners are...;;1
2874108;;and how big your... pocketbook is.;;1
2874109;;- did you call for assistance? - yes, i did.;;1
2874110;;are you having a problem, master kenobi?;;1
2874111;;yes, i'm looking for a planetary system called kamino.;;1
2874112;;it doesn't show up on the archive charts.;;1
2874113;;kamino. it's not a system i'm familiar with.;;1
2874114;;are you sure you have the right coordinates?;;1
2874115;;according to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here...;;1
2874116;;just south of the rishi maze.;;1
2874117;;i hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for...;;1
2874119;;impossible. perhaps the archives are incomplete.;;1
2874120;;if an item does not appear in our records...;;1
2874121;;it does not exist.;;1
2874122;;hey, you! no droids!;;1
2874125;;must be difficult, having sworn your life to thejedi...;;1
2874126;;not being able to visit the places you like or do the things you like.;;1
2874127;;or be with the people that i love.;;1
2874128;;are you allowed to love?;;1
2874129;;i thought that was forbidden for a jedi.;;1
2874132;;compassion, which i would define as unconditional love...;;1
2874133;;is central to a jedi's life.;;1
2874134;;so you might say that we are encouraged to love.;;1
2874135;;you've changed so much.;;1
2874136;;you haven't changed a bit.;;1
2874137;;you're exactly the way i remember you in my dreams.;;1
2874138;;reach out. sense the force around you.;;1
2874139;;use your feelings you must.;;1
2874141;;a visitor we have.;;1
2874144;;i'm sorry to disturb you, master.;;1
2874145;;what help can i be, obi-wan?;;1
2874146;;i'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend.;;1
2874147;;i trust him, but the systems don't show on the archive maps.;;1
2874148;;lost a planet master obi-wan has.;;1
2874151;;gather round the map reader.;;1
2874153;;and find obi-wan's wayward planet we will.;;1
2874154;;it ought to be here...;;1
2874156;;gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot.;;1
2874158;;but the star and all the planets...;;1
2874160;;how can this be?;;1
2874164;;because someone erased it from the archive memory.;;1
2874165;;truly wonderful the mind of a child is.;;1
2874166;;the padawan is right.;;1
2874167;;go to the center of gravity's pull...;;1
2874168;;and find your planet you will.;;1
2874169;;the data must have been erased.;;1
2874170;;but who could empty information from the archives? isn't that impossible?;;1
2874171;;dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is.;;1
2874172;;only a jedi could have erased those files.;;1
2874173;;but who and why, harder to answer.;;1
2874174;;meditate on this i will.;;1
2874175;;i wasn't the youngest queen ever elected...;;1
2874176;;but now that i think back on it, i'm not sure i was old enough.;;1
2874177;;i'm not sure i was ready.;;1
2874178;;the people you served thought you did a good job.;;1
2874179;;i heard they even tried to amend the constitution...;;1
2874180;;so you could stay in office.;;1
2874181;;i was relieved when my two terms were up.;;1
2874182;;but when the queen asked me to serve as senator...;;1
2874183;;i couldn't refuse her.;;1
2874184;;i agree with her. i think the republic needs you.;;1
2874185;;i'm glad that you chose to serve.;;1
2874186;;if the senate votes to create an army, it's sure to push us into a civil war.;;1
2874188;;there hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the republic.;;1
2874189;;do you see any way through negotiations...;;1
2874190;;to bring the separatists back into the republic?;;1
2874191;;not if they feel threatened.;;1
2874192;;they'll turn to the trade federations or the commerce guilds for help.;;1
2874194;;but after four trials in the supreme court...;;1
2874195;;nute gunray is still the viceroy of the trade federation.;;1
2874196;;i fear the senate is powerless to resolve this crisis.;;1
2874197;;we must keep our faith in the republic.;;1
2874198;;the day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.;;1
2874199;;let's pray that day never comes.;;1
2874200;;in the meantime, we must consider your own safety.;;1
2874201;;what is your suggestion, masterjedi?;;1
2874202;;anakin's not a jedi yet. he's still a padawan learner.;;1
2874203;;- but i was thinking... - hold on a minute.;;1
2874205;;i was thinking i would stay in the lake country.;;1
2874206;;there are some places up there that are very isolated.;;1
2874207;;excuse me. i'm in charge of security here, milady.;;1
2874208;;and this is my home. i know it very well. that is why we're here.;;1
2874209;;i think it would be wise...;;1
2874210;;if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance.;;1
2874212;;perfect. it's settled, then.;;1
2874213;;there it is, r4, right where it should be.;;1
2874214;;our missing planet kamino.;;1
2874216;;the prime minister is expecting you.;;1
2874217;;- i'm expected? - of course.;;1
2874218;;he is anxious to meet you.;;1
2874219;;after all these years...;;1
2874220;;we were beginning to think you weren't coming.;;1
2874221;;now, please, this way.;;1
2874222;;may i present lama su...;;1
2874223;;prime minister of kamino.;;1
2874224;;and this is masterjedi...;;1
2874226;;i trust you're going to enjoy your stay.;;1
2874228;;and now to business.;;1
2874229;;you will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule.;;1
2874230;;200,000 units are ready...;;1
2874231;;with a million more well on the way.;;1
2874233;;please tell your master sifo-dyas...;;1
2874234;;that his order will be met on time.;;1
2874236;;jedi master sifo-dyas is still...;;1
2874237;;a leading member of thejedi council, is he not?;;1
2874238;;master sifo-dyas was killed almost ten years ago.;;1
2874239;;i'm so sorry to hear that.;;1
2874240;;but i'm sure he would have been proud of the army we've built for him.;;1
2874242;;yes, a clone army, and i must say...;;1
2874243;;one of the finest we've ever created.;;1
2874244;;tell me, prime minister...;;1
2874245;;when my master first contacted you about the army...;;1
2874246;;did he say who it was for?;;1
2874247;;of course he did.;;1
2874248;;this army is for the republic.;;1
2874249;;but you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.;;1
2874250;;that's why i'm here.;;1
2874251;;we used to come here for school retreat.;;1
2874252;;we would swim to that island every day.;;1
2874253;;i love the water.;;1
2874254;;we used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us...;;1
2874255;;and try to guess the names of the birds singing.;;1
2874256;;i don't like sand.;;1
2874257;;it's coarse and rough and irritating...;;1
2874258;;and it gets everywhere.;;1
2874260;;here, everything is soft...;;1
2874263;;i shouldn't have done that.;;1
2874266;;i'd hoped you would be pleased.;;1
2874267;;clones can think creatively.;;1
2874268;;you will find that they are immensely superior to droids.;;1
2874269;;we take great pride in our combat education and training programs.;;1
2874270;;this group was created about five years ago.;;1
2874271;;you mentioned growth acceleration.;;1
2874272;;oh, yes, it's essential.;;1
2874273;;otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow.;;1
2874274;;now we can do it in half the time.;;1
2874276;;they are totally obedient...;;1
2874277;;taking any order without question.;;1
2874278;;we modified their genetic structure...;;1
2874279;;to make them less independent than the original host.;;1
2874280;;and who was the original host?;;1
2874281;;a bounty hunter called jango fett.;;1
2874282;;and where is this bounty hunter now?;;1
2874283;;oh, we keep him here.;;1
2874284;;apart from his pay, which is considerable...;;1
2874285;;fett demanded only one thing:;;1
2874286;;an unaltered clone for himself.;;1
2874287;;- curious, isn't it? - "unaltered"?;;1
2874289;;no tampering with the structure to make it more docile...;;1
2874290;;and no growth acceleration.;;1
2874291;;i should very much like to meet this jango fett.;;1
2874292;;i would be very happy to arrange it for you.;;1
2874295;;sure you do. you just don't want to tell me.;;1
2874296;;you gonna use one of your jedi mind tricks on me?;;1
2874297;;they only work on the weak-minded.;;1
2874299;;i was 12. his name was palo.;;1
2874300;;we were both in the legislative youth program.;;1
2874301;;he was a few years older than i. very cute.;;1
2874302;;dark, curly hair. dreamy eyes.;;1
2874303;;all right, i get the picture.;;1
2874304;;whatever happened to him?;;1
2874305;;i went into public service. he went on to become an artist.;;1
2874306;;maybe he was the smart one.;;1
2874307;;you really don't like politicians, do you?;;1
2874308;;i like two or three...;;1
2874309;;but i'm not really sure about one of them.;;1
2874310;;i don't think the system works.;;1
2874311;;how would you have it work?;;1
2874312;;we need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem...;;1
2874313;;agree what's in the best interest of all the people...;;1
2874314;;and then do it.;;1
2874315;;that's exactly what we do.;;1
2874316;;the trouble is that people don't always agree.;;1
2874317;;well, then they should be made to.;;1
2874318;;- by whom? who's gonna make them? - i don't know. someone.;;1
2874319;;- you? - of course not me.;;1
2874320;;- but someone. - someone wise.;;1
2874321;;sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.;;1
2874322;;well, if it works.;;1
2874323;;- you're making fun of me. - no.;;1
2874324;;i'd be much too frightened to tease a senator.;;1
2874325;;ani, are you all right?;;1
2874326;;boba, is your father here?;;1
2874328;;may we see him?;;1
2874330;;dad, taun we's here.;;1
2874332;;was your trip productive?;;1
2874334;;this is jedi master obi-wan kenobi.;;1
2874335;;he's come to check on our progress.;;1
2874336;;your clones are very impressive. you must be very proud.;;1
2874337;;i'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe.;;1
2874338;;ever made your way as far into the interior as coruscant?;;1
2874339;;- once or twice. - recently?;;1
2874341;;then you must know master sifo-dyas.;;1
2874342;;boba, rood eht so-heeck.;;1
2874345;;is he not thejedi who hired you for this job?;;1
2874346;;never heard of him.;;1
2874348;;i was recruited by a man called tyranus on one of the moons of bogden.;;1
2874350;;do you like your army?;;1
2874351;;i look forward to seeing them in action.;;1
2874352;;they'll do their job well. i'll guarantee that.;;1
2874353;;thank you for your time, jango.;;1
2874354;;always a pleasure to meet a jedi.;;1
2874355;;what is it, dad?;;1
2874356;;pack your things. we're leaving.;;1
2874357;;and when i got to them, we went into aggressive negotiations.;;1
2874358;;"aggressive negotiations"? what's that?;;1
2874359;;well, negotiations with a lightsaber.;;1
2874360;;if master obi-wan caught me doing this, he'd be very grumpy.;;1
2874361;;from the moment i met you...;;1
2874362;;all those years ago...;;1
2874363;;not a day has gone by when i haven't thought of you.;;1
2874364;;and now that i'm with you again...;;1
2874366;;the closer i get to you, the worse it gets.;;1
2874367;;the thought of not being with you...;;1
2874369;;i'm haunted by the kiss...;;1
2874370;;that you should never have given me.;;1
2874371;;my heart is beating...;;1
2874372;;hoping that that kiss will not become a scar.;;1
2874373;;you are in my very soul...;;1
2874375;;what can i do? i will do anything that you ask.;;1
2874376;;if you are suffering as much as i am, please, tell me.;;1
2874378;;we can't. it's... just not possible.;;1
2874379;;anything is possible, padmé. listen to me.;;1
2874381;;we live in a real world. come back to it.;;1
2874382;;you're studying to become a jedi. i'm a senator.;;1
2874383;;if you follow your thoughts through to conclusion...;;1
2874384;;it'll take us to a place we cannot go...;;1
2874385;;regardless of the way we feel about each other.;;1
2874386;;then you do feel something.;;1
2874387;;i will not let you give up your future for me.;;1
2874388;;you are asking me to be rational.;;1
2874389;;that is something i know i cannot do.;;1
2874390;;believe me, i wish that i could just wish away my feelings...;;1
2874392;;i will not give in to this.;;1
2874394;;it wouldn't have to be that way.;;1
2874395;;we could keep it a secret.;;1
2874396;;we'd be living a lie...;;1
2874397;;one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to.;;1
2874398;;i couldn't do that.;;1
2874399;;could you, anakin? could you live like that?;;1
2874401;;it would destroy us.;;1
2874402;;tell your council that the first battalions are ready.;;1
2874403;;and remind them, if they need more troops...;;1
2874404;;it will take more time to grow them.;;1
2874405;;i won't forget, and thank you.;;1
2874408;;scramble code five to coruscant, care of the old folks' home!;;1
2874409;;i have successfully made contact with the prime minister of kamino.;;1
2874410;;they are using a bounty hunter named jango fett to create a clone army.;;1
2874411;;i have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter...;;1
2874412;;is the assassin we are looking for.;;1
2874413;;do you think these cloners are involved...;;1
2874414;;in the plot to assassinate senator amidala?;;1
2874415;;no, master. there appears to be no motive.;;1
2874416;;do not assume anything, obi-wan.;;1
2874417;;clear your mind must be...;;1
2874418;;if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.;;1
2874420;;they say master sifo-dyas placed an order for a clone army...;;1
2874421;;at the request of the senate almost ten years ago.;;1
2874422;;i was under the impression he was killed before that.;;1
2874423;;did the council ever authorize the creation of a clone army?;;1
2874424;;no. whoever placed that order...;;1
2874425;;did not have the authorization of thejedi council.;;1
2874426;;bring him here. question him we will.;;1
2874427;;yes, master. i will report back when i have him.;;1
2874428;;blind we are if creation of this clone army...;;1
2874429;;we could not see.;;1
2874430;;i think it is time we informed the senate...;;1
2874431;;that our ability to use the force has diminished.;;1
2874432;;only the dark lord of the sith knows of our weakness.;;1
2874433;;if informed the senate is...;;1
2874434;;multiply our adversaries will.;;1
2874438;;i don't want to disturb you.;;1
2874439;;your presence is soothing.;;1
2874440;;you had another nightmare last night.;;1
2874441;;jedi don't have nightmares.;;1
2874443;;i saw my mother.;;1
2874444;;she is suffering, padmé.;;1
2874445;;i saw her as clearly as i see you now.;;1
2874446;;she is in pain.;;1
2874447;;i know i'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, senator...;;1
2874448;;but i have to go.;;1
2874449;;i have to help her.;;1
2874450;;i'll go with you.;;1
2874451;;i'm sorry. i don't have a choice.;;1
2874453;;boba, get on board!;;1
2874458;;let me help you with that.;;1
2874459;;what? what do you want?;;1
2874460;;wait! you're a jedi!;;1
2874461;;whatever it is, i didn't do it.;;1
2874462;;i'm looking for shmi skywalker.;;1
2874466;;you are ani! it is you!;;1
2874467;;you sure sprouted, huh?;;1
2874469;;maybe you could help with some deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.;;1
2874472;;she's not mine-a no more-a. i sold her.;;1
2874473;;- you sold her? - years ago.;;1
2874474;;sorry, ani, but you know, business is business.;;1
2874475;;i sold her to a moisture farmer named lars.;;1
2874476;;at least i think it was lars.;;1
2874477;;believe it or not, i heard he freed her and married her!;;1
2874478;;can ya beat that, eh?;;1
2874479;;do you know where they are now?;;1
2874480;;long way from here.;;1
2874481;;someplace over on the other side of mos eisley, i think.;;1
2874482;;i'd like to know.;;1
2874484;;let's go look at my records, huh?;;1
2874485;;dad! i think we're being tracked!;;1
2874486;;he must have put a homing device on our hull.;;1
2874487;;hang on, son. we'll move into the asteroid field...;;1
2874488;;and we'll have a couple of surprises for him.;;1
2874491;;he doesn't seem to take a hint, this guy.;;1
2874493;;get him, dad! fire!;;1
2874494;;blast! this is why i hate flying!;;1
2874496;;we'll just have to finish him.;;1
2874497;;r4, prepare to jettison the spare part canisters.;;1
2874499;;we won't be seeing him again.;;1
2874500;;well, r4, i think we've waited long enough.;;1
2874501;;there's an unusual concentration of federation ships over there, r4.;;1
2874502;;stay with the ship, r2.;;1
2874503;;hello. how might i be of service? i am c...;;1
2874507;;i knew you would return. i knew it!;;1
2874508;;and miss padmé. oh, my.;;1
2874510;;bless my circuits! i'm so pleased to see you both.;;1
2874511;;i've come to see my mother.;;1
2874512;;i think perhaps we'd better go indoors.;;1
2874513;;master owen, might i present two most important visitors.;;1
2874516;;- this is my girlfriend, beru. - hello.;;1
2874518;;i guess i'm your stepbrother.;;1
2874519;;i had a feeling you might show up someday.;;1
2874520;;is my mother here?;;1
2874523;;shmi is my wife.;;1
2874524;;we should go inside. we have a lot to talk about.;;1
2874525;;it was just before dawn. they came out of nowhere.;;1
2874526;;a hunting party oftusken raiders.;;1
2874527;;your mother had gone out early, like she always did...;;1
2874528;;to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators.;;1
2874529;;from the tracks, she was about halfway home...;;1
2874530;;when they took her.;;1
2874531;;those tuskens walk like men...;;1
2874532;;but they're vicious, mindless monsters.;;1
2874533;;thirty of us went out after her. four of us came back.;;1
2874534;;i'd be out there with them, but after i lost my leg...;;1
2874535;;i just couldn't ride anymore until i heal.;;1
2874536;;i don't want to give up on her...;;1
2874537;;but she's been gone a month.;;1
2874538;;there's little hope she's lasted this long.;;1
2874539;;where are you going?;;1
2874540;;to find my mother.;;1
2874541;;your mother's dead, son. accept it.;;1
2874542;;you're gonna have to stay here.;;1
2874543;;these are good people, padmé. you'll be safe.;;1
2874544;;i won't be long.;;1
2874545;;we must persuade the commerce guild...;;1
2874546;;and the corporate alliance to sign the treaty.;;1
2874547;;what about the senator from naboo?;;1
2874548;;is she dead yet?;;1
2874549;;i am not signing your treaty until i have her head on my desk.;;1
2874550;;i am a man of my word, viceroy.;;1

2874552;;you'll have the finest army in the galaxy.;;1
2874553;;as i explained to you earlier...;;1
2874554;;i am quite convinced that 10,000 more systems...;;1
2874555;;will rally to our cause with your support, gentlemen.;;1
2874556;;what you are proposing could be construed as treason.;;1
2874557;;the techno union army...;;1
2874558;;is at your disposal, count.;;1
2874559;;the banking clan will sign your treaty.;;1
2874561;;our friends from the trade federation have pledged their support...;;1
2874562;;and when their battle droids are combined with yours...;;1
2874563;;we shall have an army greater than any in the galaxy.;;1
2874564;;thejedi will be overwhelmed.;;1
2874565;;the republic will agree to any demands we make.;;1
2874570;;i'm here, mom. you're safe.;;1
2874571;;you look so handsome.;;1
2874574;;i'm so proud of you, ani.;;1
2874576;;now i am complete.;;1

2874586;;something terrible has happened.;;1
2874587;;young skywalker is in pain...;;1
2874589;;the transmitter is working, but we're not receiving a return signal.;;1
2874590;;coruscant's too far. r4, can you boost the power?;;1
2874591;;we'll have to try something else.;;1
2874592;;maybe we can contact anakin on naboo.;;1
2874594;;anakin, do you copy?;;1
2874595;;this is obi-wan kenobi. anakin?;;1
2874596;;he's not on naboo, r4.;;1

2874600;;but it's coming from tatooine.;;1
2874601;;what in the blazes is he doing there?;;1
2874602;;i told him to stay on naboo.;;1

2874618;;i know i could have!;;1
2874619;;sometimes there are things no one can fix.;;1
2874620;;- you're not all-powerful, ani. - well, i should be!;;1
2874621;;someday i will be.;;1
2874622;;i will be the most powerfuljedi ever.;;1
2874624;;i will even learn to stop people from dying.;;1
2874625;;it's all obi-wan's fault! he's jealous!;;1
2874626;;he's holding me back!;;1
2874629;;i killed them all.;;1
2874631;;every single one of them.;;1
2874632;;and not just the men...;;1
2874634;;and the children too.;;1
2874636;;and i slaughtered them like animals!;;1
2874638;;to be angry is to be human.;;1
2874640;;i know i'm better than this.;;1
2874641;;i know wherever you are it's become a better place.;;1
2874642;;you were the most loving partner a man could ever have.;;1
2874643;;good-bye, my darling wife.;;1
2874645;;i wasn't strong enough to save you, mom.;;1
2874646;;i wasn't strong enough.;;1
2874647;;but i promise i won't fail again.;;1
2874650;;r2? what are you doing here?;;1
2874651;;it seems that he is carrying a message from an obi-wan kenobi.;;1
2874652;;master ani, does that name mean anything to you?;;1
2874653;;anakin, my long-range transmitter has been knocked out.;;1
2874654;;retransmit this message to coruscant.;;1
2874655;;i have tracked the bounty hunter, jango fett...;;1
2874656;;to the droid foundries on geonosis.;;1
2874657;;the trade federation is to take delivery of a droid army here...;;1
2874658;;and it is clear that viceroy gunray...;;1
2874659;;is behind the assassination attempts on senator amidala.;;1
2874660;;the commerce guilds and the corporate alliance...;;1
2874661;;have both pledged their armies to count dooku and are forming...;;1
2874663;;more happening on geonosis, i feel, than has been revealed.;;1
2874665;;we will deal with count dooku.;;1
2874666;;the most important thing for you is to stay where you are.;;1
2874667;;protect the senator at all costs.;;1
2874668;;that is your first priority.;;1
2874670;;they'll never get there in time to save him.;;1
2874671;;they have to come halfway across the galaxy. look.;;1
2874672;;geonosis is less than a parsec away.;;1
2874673;;if he's still alive.;;1
2874674;;are you just gonna sit here and let him die?;;1
2874675;;- he's your friend, your mentor. - he's like my father!;;1
2874676;;but you heard master windu. he gave me strict orders to stay here.;;1
2874677;;he gave you strict orders to protect me...;;1
2874678;;and i'm going to help obi-wan.;;1
2874679;;if you plan to protect me, you'll just have to come along.;;1
2874680;;i'm not worried, r2. it's just i've never flown before.;;1
2874681;;the commerce guilds are preparing for war. there can be no doubt of that.;;1
2874682;;count dooku must have made a treaty with them.;;1
2874683;;the debate is over.;;1
2874684;;now we need that clone army.;;1
2874685;;unfortunately, the debate is not over.;;1
2874686;;the senate will never approve the use of clones...;;1
2874687;;before the separatists attack.;;1
2874688;;this is a crisis.;;1
2874689;;the senate must vote the chancellor emergency powers.;;1
2874690;;he can then approve the creation of an army.;;1
2874691;;but what senator would have the courage...;;1
2874692;;to propose such a radical amendment?;;1
2874693;;if only senator amidala were here.;;1
2874695;;oh, no, my friend. this is a mistake, a terrible mistake.;;1
2874696;;they have gone too far. this is madness.;;1
2874697;;i thought you were the leader here, dooku.;;1
2874698;;this had nothing to do with me, i assure you.;;1
2874699;;i will petition immediately to have you set free.;;1
2874700;;well, i hope it doesn't take too long. i have work to do.;;1
2874701;;may i ask why a jedi knight...;;1
2874702;;is all the way out here on geonosis?;;1
2874703;;i've been tracking a bounty hunter named jango fett.;;1
2874704;;do you know him?;;1
2874705;;there are no bounty hunters here that i am aware of.;;1
2874706;;the geonosians don't trust them.;;1
2874707;;who can blame them? but he is here, i can assure you.;;1
2874708;;it's a great pity our paths have never crossed before, obi-wan.;;1
2874709;;qui-gon always spoke very highly of you.;;1
2874710;;i wish he were still alive.;;1
2874711;;i could use his help right now.;;1
2874712;;qui-gon jinn would never join you.;;1
2874713;;don't be so sure, my young jedi.;;1
2874714;;you forget that he was once my apprentice...;;1
2874715;;just as you were once his.;;1
2874716;;he knew all about the corruption in the senate...;;1
2874717;;but he wouldn't have gone along with it if he had learned the truth as i have.;;1
2874718;;- the truth? - the truth.;;1
2874719;;what if i told you that the republic was now under the control...;;1
2874720;;of the dark lord of the sith?;;1
2874721;;no, that's not possible. the jedi would be aware of it.;;1
2874722;;the dark side of the force has clouded their vision, my friend.;;1
2874723;;hundreds of senators are now under the influence...;;1
2874724;;of a sith lord called darth sidious.;;1
2874725;;i don't believe you.;;1
2874726;;the viceroy of the trade federation...;;1
2874727;;was once in league with this darth sidious...;;1
2874728;;but he was betrayed ten years ago by the dark lord.;;1
2874729;;he came to me for help. he told me everything.;;1
2874730;;you must join me, obi-wan...;;1
2874731;;and together we will destroy the sith!;;1
2874732;;i will never join you, dooku.;;1
2874733;;it may be difficult to secure your release.;;1
2874734;;it's-a clear desa separatists made a pact...;;1
2874735;;wesa desa federation du trade.;;1
2874737;;in response to this direct threat to the republic...;;1
2874738;;mesa propose that the senate...;;1
2874739;;give immediately emergency powers...;;1
2874740;;to the supreme chancellor.;;1
2874742;;order! we shall have order!;;1
2874743;;it is with great reluctance...;;1
2874744;;that i have agreed to this calling.;;1
2874745;;i love democracy. i love the republic.;;1
2874746;;the power you give me...;;1
2874747;;i will lay down when this crisis has abated.;;1
2874748;;and as my first act with this new authority...;;1
2874749;;i will create a grand army of the republic...;;1
2874750;;to counter the increasing threats of the separatists.;;1
2874751;;it is done, then.;;1
2874752;;i will take whatjedi we have left and go to geonosis and help obi-wan.;;1
2874753;;visit i will the cloners on kamino...;;1
2874754;;and see this army they have created for the republic.;;1
2874755;;see those columns of steam straight ahead?;;1
2874756;;they're exhaust vents of some type.;;1
2874758;;look, whatever happens out there, follow my lead.;;1
2874759;;i'm not interested in getting into a war here.;;1
2874760;;as a member of the senate...;;1
2874761;;maybe i can find a diplomatic solution to this mess.;;1
2874763;;i've given up trying to argue with you.;;1
2874764;;my obtuse little friend, if they had needed our help...;;1
2874765;;they would have asked for it.;;1
2874766;;you obviously have a great deal to learn about human behavior.;;1
2874767;;for a mechanic, you seem to do an excessive amount of thinking.;;1
2874768;;i am programmed to understand humans!;;1
2874769;;"what does that mean?";;1
2874770;;that means i am in charge here!;;1
2874771;;where are you going now?;;1
2874772;;you don't know what's out there. have you no sense at all?;;1
2874775;;do you know where you're going?;;1
2874783;;you'll get your chance...;;1
2874786;;i want to go home!;;1
2874787;;what did i do to deserve this?;;1
2874788;;i wonder what happened to poor little r2.;;1
2874789;;he's always getting himself into trouble.;;1
2874794;;obi-wan's gonna kill me.;;1
2874798;;i'm not afraid to die.;;1
2874799;;i've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.;;1
2874800;;what are you talking about?;;1
2874803;;i thought we had decided not to fall in love...;;1
2874804;;that we would be forced to live a lie...;;1
2874805;;and that it would destroy our lives.;;1
2874806;;i think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway.;;1
2874809;;and before we die, i want you to know.;;1
2874810;;i was beginning to wonder if you'd got my message.;;1
2874811;;i retransmitted it just as you had requested, master.;;1
2874812;;then we decided to come and rescue you.;;1
2874814;;settle down. settle down.;;1
2874815;;let the executions begin.;;1
2874816;;i've got a bad feeling about this.;;1
2874817;;just relax. concentrate. - what about padmé?;;1
2874818;;she seems to be on top of things.;;1
2874819;;she can't do that!;;1
2874820;;shoot her... or something!;;1
2874822;;this isn't how it's supposed to be!;;1
2874823;;jango! finish her off!;;1
2874824;;patience, viceroy, patience. she will die.;;1
2874826;;how pleasant of you to join us.;;1
2874829;;but foolish, my old jedi friend.;;1
2874831;;i don't think so.;;1
2874833;;my legs aren't moving. i must need maintenance.;;1
2874834;;what's all this noise? a battle!;;1
2874835;;there's been some terrible mistake!;;1
2874836;;i'm programmed for etiquette, not destruction!;;1
2874838;;oh! what did i say?;;1
2874839;;oh, dear. i'm terribly sorry about all this.;;1
2874840;;excuse me. i'm trapped. i can't get up.;;1
2874841;;- you call this a diplomatic solution? - no, i call it aggressive negotiations.;;1
2874842;;- uh-oh. - roger, roger.;;1
2874843;;r2, what are you doing here?;;1
2874844;;what are you doing?;;1
2874845;;stop that! you're going to strain something.;;1
2874847;;now where are you taking me? this is such a drag!;;1
2874848;;i'm quite beside myself.;;1
2874849;;r2, please be careful! you're singeing my circuits!;;1
2874850;;yes, but is my head on straight?;;1
2874852;;you have fought gallantly...;;1
2874853;;worthy of recognition in the archives of thejedi order.;;1
2874857;;and your lives will be spared.;;1
2874858;;we will not be hostages to be bartered, dooku!;;1
2874860;;i'm sorry, old friend.;;1
2874862;;around the survivors a perimeter create.;;1
2874863;;i've had the most peculiar dream!;;1
2874865;;rally more systems to his cause he will.;;1
2874867;;aim right above the fuel cells!;;1
2874868;;good call, my young padawan.;;1
2874869;;thejedi have amassed a huge army.;;1
2874870;;that doesn't seem possible.;;1
2874871;;how could thejedi come up with an army so quickly?;;1
2874872;;we must send all available droids into battle.;;1
2874873;;there are too many.;;1
2874874;;our communications have been jammed.;;1
2874875;;pilot, land in that assembly area!;;1
2874878;;i have five special commando units awaiting your orders, sir.;;1
2874879;;to the forward command center take me.;;1
2874880;;attack those federation starships, quickly!;;1
2874881;;master yoda, all forward positions are advancing.;;1
2874884;;this is not looking good at all!;;1
2874885;;we must get the starships back into space.;;1
2874886;;we have to order a retreat.;;1
2874887;;my master will never allow the republic...;;1
2874888;;to get away with this treachery.;;1
2874889;;i'm sending my warriors to hide in the catacombs.;;1
2874890;;thejedi must not find our designs for the ultimate weapon.;;1
2874891;;if they find out what we are planning to build, we're doomed.;;1
2874892;;i will take the designs with me to coruscant.;;1
2874893;;they will be much safer there with my master.;;1
2874894;;concentrate all your fire on the nearest starship.;;1
2874896;;move all quadrants to sector 515.;;1
2874898;;it's dooku! shoot him down!;;1
2874899;;we're out of rockets, sir.;;1
2874900;;- follow him! - we're gonna need some help!;;1
2874901;;there isn't time! anakin and i can handle this!;;1
2874902;;put the ship down!;;1
2874903;;don't let your personal feelings get in the way!;;1
2874905;;- lower the ship! - i can't take dooku alone!;;1
2874906;;i need you! if we catch him, we can end this war right now!;;1
2874907;;- we have a job to do! - i don't care! put the ship down!;;1
2874908;;you will be expelled from thejedi order!;;1
2874909;;- i can't leave her! - come to your senses!;;1
2874910;;what do you think padmé would do were she in your position?;;1
2874911;;she would do her duty.;;1
2874912;;the droid army is in full retreat.;;1
2874913;;well done, commander. bring me a ship.;;1
2874914;;you're gonna pay for all thejedi that you killed today, dooku.;;1
2874915;;we'll take him together.;;1
2874916;;- i'm taking him now! - no, anakin! no!;;1
2874917;;as you see, myjedi powers are far beyond yours.;;1
2874919;;i don't think so.;;1
2874920;;master kenobi, you disappoint me.;;1
2874921;;yoda holds you in such high esteem.;;1
2874922;;surely you can do better.;;1
2874923;;are you all right?;;1
2874925;;we'd better get back to the forward command center.;;1
2874927;;gather what troops you can. we've got to get to that hangar.;;1
2874928;;get a transport. hurry!;;1
2874930;;brave of you, boy.;;1
2874931;;but i would have thought you had learned your lesson.;;1
2874932;;i am a slow learner.;;1
2874935;;you have interfered with our affairs for the last time.;;1
2874936;;powerful you have become, dooku.;;1
2874937;;the dark side i sense in you.;;1
2874938;;i've become more powerful than anyjedi.;;1
2874940;;much to learn you still have.;;1
2874941;;it is obvious that this contest cannot be decided...;;1
2874942;;by our knowledge of the force...;;1
2874943;;but by our skills with a lightsaber.;;1
2874944;;fought well you have, my old padawan.;;1
2874945;;this is just the beginning.;;1
2874946;;the force is with us, master sidious.;;1
2874947;;welcome home, lord tyranus.;;1
2874948;;you have done well.;;1
2874949;;i have good news for you, my lord.;;1
2874950;;- the war has begun. - excellent.;;1
2874951;;everything is going as planned.;;1
2874952;;do you believe what count dooku said about sidious controlling the senate?;;1
2874953;;it doesn't feel right.;;1
2874954;;joined the dark side dooku has.;;1
2874956;;creating mistrust are his ways now.;;1
2874958;;i feel we should keep a closer eye on the senate.;;1
2874960;;where is your apprentice?;;1
2874961;;on his way to naboo, escorting senator amidala home.;;1
2874962;;i have to admit that without the clones, it would not have been a victory.;;1
2874965;;master obi-wan, not victory.;;1
2874966;;the shroud of the dark side has fallen.;;1
2874967;;begun the clone war has.;;1
1870084;;tell them we wish to board at once.;;1
1870085;;with all due respect,;;1
1870086;;the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor wish to board immediately.;;1
1870088;;as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal,;;1
1870089;;and we'd be happy to receive the ambassadors.;;1
1870090;;i'm tc-14 at your service.;;1
1870092;;we are greatly honored by your visit, ambassadors.;;1
1870094;;my master will be with you shortly.;;1
1870095;;i have a bad feeling about this.;;1
1870096;;i don't sense anything. it's not about the mission, master.;;1
1870097;;it's something... elsewhere, elusive.;;1
1870098;;don't center on your anxieties, obi-wan.;;1
1870099;;keep your concentration here and now, where it belongs.;;1
1870100;;but master yoda said i should be mindful of the future.;;1
1870101;;but not at the expense of the moment.;;1
1870102;;be mindful of the living force, young padawan.;;1
1870104;;how do you think this trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands?;;1
1870105;;these federation types are cowards.;;1
1870106;;the negotiations will be short.;;1
1870107;;what? what did you say?;;1
1870108;;the ambassadors are jedi knights, i believe.;;1
1870110;;they're here to force a settlement.;;1
1870111;;distract them. i will contact lord sidious.;;1
1870113;;i'm not going in there with two jedi.;;1
1870115;;is it in their nature to make us wait this long?;;1
1870116;;no. i sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute.;;1
1870118;;this scheme of yours has failed, lord sidious.;;1
1870119;;the blockade is finished. we dare not go against these jedi.;;1
1870120;;viceroy, i don't want this stunted slime in my sight again.;;1
1870121;;this turn of events is unfortunate.;;1
1870122;;we must accelerate our plans. begin landing your troops.;;1
1870123;;my lord, is that legal?;;1
1870124;;i will make it legal.;;1
1870126;;the chancellor should never have brought them into this. kill them immediately.;;1
1870127;;yes. yes, my lord. uh, as you wish.;;1
1870132;;they must be dead by now.;;1
1870133;;destroy what's left of them.;;1
1870135;;- check it out, corporal. we'll cover you. - roger, roger.;;1
1870137;;what is going on down there?;;1
1870138;;we lost the transmission, sir.;;1
1870139;;have you ever encountered a jedi knight before, sir?;;1
1870140;;well, no, but i don't-seal off the bridge.;;1
1870141;;yes, sir. that won't be enough, sir.;;1
1870142;;i want droidekas up here at once!;;1
1870143;;we will not survive this.;;1
1870144;;close the blast doors!;;1
1870145;;that will hold them.;;1
1870146;;they are still coming through.;;1
1870148;;where are those droidekas?;;1
1870150;;they have shield generators!;;1
1870151;;it's a standoff. let's go.;;1
1870152;;they're no match for droidekas.;;1
1870153;;sir! they've gone up the ventilation shaft.;;1
1870154;;battle droids. it's an invasion army.;;1
1870155;;this is an odd play for the trade federation.;;1
1870156;;we've got to warn the naboo and contact chancellor valorum.;;1
1870157;;let's split up. stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet.;;1
1870158;;you were right about one thing, master.;;1
1870159;;the negotiations were short.;;1
1870160;;sir, a transmission from the planet.;;1
1870161;;it's queen amidala herself.;;1
1870162;;at last we are getting results.;;1
1870163;;again you come before us, your highness.;;1
1870164;;you will not be so pleased when you hear what i have to say, viceroy.;;1
1870165;;your trade boycott of our planet has ended.;;1
1870166;;i was not aware of such failure.;;1
1870167;;i have word that the chancellor's ambassadors are with you now...;;1
1870168;;and that you have been commanded to reach settlement.;;1
1870169;;i know nothing of any ambassadors.;;1
1870170;;you must be mistaken.;;1
1870172;;the federation has gone too far this time.;;1
1870173;;we would never do anything without the approval of the senate.;;1
1870174;;you assume too much.;;1
1870176;;she's right. the senate will never- it's too late now.;;1
1870177;;do you think she suspects an attack? i don't know.;;1
1870178;;but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there.;;1
1870179;;negotiations haven't started because the ambassadors aren't there?;;1
1870180;;how could that be true?;;1
1870181;;i have assurances from the chancellor his ambassadors did arrive.;;1

1870604;;i can't believe there's still slavery in the galaxy.;;1
1870605;;the republic's antislavery laws-;;1
1870606;;the republic doesn't exist out here.;;1
1870607;;we must survive on our own.;;1
1870609;;has anybody ever seen a podrace?;;1
1870610;;they have podracing on malastare. very fast, very dangerous.;;1
1870611;;i'm the only human who can do it.;;1
1870612;;you must have jedi reflexes if you race pods.;;1
1870613;;don't do that again.;;1
1870614;;you're a jedi knight, aren't you?;;1
1870615;;what makes you think that?;;1
1870616;;i saw your laser sword. only jedis carry that kind of weapon.;;1
1870617;;perhaps i killed a jedi and took it from him.;;1
1870618;;i don't think so.;;1
1870619;;no one can kill a jedi.;;1
1870620;;i wish that were so.;;1
1870621;;i had a dream i was a jedi.;;1
1870622;;i came back here and freed all the slaves.;;1
1870623;;have you come to free us? no, i'm afraid not.;;1
1870624;;i think you have. why else would you be here?;;1
1870625;;i can see there's no fooling you, anakin.;;1
1870626;;we're on our way to coruscant, the central system in the republic,;;1
1870627;;on a very important mission.;;1
1870628;;how did you end up out here in the outer rim?;;1
1870629;;our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it.;;1
1870631;;i can fix anything. i believe you can.;;1
1870632;;but first we must acquire the parts we need.;;1
1870633;;wit no-nutten mula to trade.;;1
1870634;;these junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.;;1
1870635;;gambling. everything here revolves around betting on those awful races.;;1
1870636;;podracing. greed can be a powerful ally.;;1
1870637;;i built a racer. it's the fastest ever.;;1
1870638;;there's a big race tomorrow on boonta eve.;;1
1870639;;- you could enter my pod. - anakin!;;1
1870640;;- watto won't let you. - watto doesn't know i've built it.;;1
1870641;;you could make him think it was yours...;;1
1870642;;and get him to let me pilot it for you.;;1
1870643;;i don't want you to race. it's awful. i die every time watto makes you do it.;;1
1870644;;but, mom, i love it.;;1
1870645;;the prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.;;1
1870648;;is there anyone friendly to the republic who can help us?;;1
1870650;;mom, you say the biggest problem in this universe is nobody helps each other.;;1
1870651;;i'm sure qui-gon doesn't want to put your son in danger.;;1
1870652;;we'll find some other way.;;1
1870654;;there is no other way.;;1
1870655;;i may not like it, but he can help you.;;1
1870656;;he was meant to help you.;;1
1870657;;are you sure about this?;;1
1870658;;trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know?;;1
1870659;;the queen will not approve.;;1
1870660;;the queen doesn't need to know.;;1
1870661;;well, i don't approve.;;1
1870662;;the boy tells me you want to sponsor him in the race.;;1
1870663;;how can you do this? not on the republic credits, i think, huh?;;1
1870664;;my ship will be the entry fee.;;1
1870666;;not bad, huh? a nubian, huh?;;1
1870667;;it's in good order, except for the parts i need.;;1
1870668;;what would the boy ride?;;1
1870669;;he smashed up my pod in the last race. it will take some long time to fix it.;;1
1870670;;it wasn't my fault, really. sebulba flashed me with his vents.;;1
1870671;;i actually saved the pod, mostly.;;1
1870672;;mmm. that you did, huh.;;1
1870673;;the boy's good. no doubts there, huh?;;1
1870674;;i have acquired a pod in a game of chance, the fastest ever built.;;1
1870675;;i hope you didn't kill anyone i know for it, huh?;;1
1870676;;so, you supply the pod and the entry fee,;;1
1870677;;and i supply the boy.;;1
1870678;;we split the winnings, um, 50-50, i think, huh?;;1
1870679;;if it's going to be 50-50, i suggest you front the cash for the entry.;;1
1870681;;you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts i need.;;1
1870682;;and if we lose, you keep my ship.;;1
1870683;;either way, you win.;;1
1870685;;your friend is a foolish one, methinks.;;1
1870686;;what if this plan fails, master?;;1
1870687;;we could be stuck here a very long time.;;1
1870688;;well, it's too dangerous to call for help,;;1
1870689;;and a ship without a power supply isn't going to get us anywhere.;;1
1870691;;there's something about this boy.;;1
1870692;;you should be very proud of your son.;;1
1870693;;he gives without any thought of reward.;;1
1870694;;well, he knows nothing of greed.;;1
1870695;;he has a- he has special powers.;;1
1870697;;he can see things before they happen.;;1
1870698;;that's why he appears to have such quick reflexes.;;1
1870699;;it's a jedi trait.;;1
1870700;;he deserves better than a slave's life. why, certainly.;;1
1870701;;had he been born in the republic, we would have identified him early.;;1
1870702;;the force is unusually strong with him. that much is clear.;;1
1870703;;who was his father?;;1
1870704;;there was no father.;;1
1870705;;i carried him, i gave birth, i raised him.;;1
1870706;;i can't explain what happened.;;1
1870707;;can you help him?;;1
1870709;;i didn't actually come here to free slaves.;;1
1870712;;wow, a real astro droid.;;1
1870713;;how did you get so lucky? that isn't the half of it.;;1
1870714;;i'm in the boonta race tomorrow. what?;;1
1870716;;you're such a joker, ani.;;1
1870717;;you've been working on that thing for years. it's never gonna run.;;1
1870718;;come on. let's go and play ball.;;1
1870719;;keep racing, ani. you're gonna be bug squash.;;1
1870721;;keep away from those energy binders.;;1
1870722;;if your hand gets caught in the beam, it's gonna go numb for hours.;;1
1870724;;my tongue is fat.;;1
1870726;;where is da wrench? oh, dare it is.;;1
1870728;;uh, ani, i'm stuck. ani...;;1
1870729;;you know, i find that jarjar creature to be a little odd.;;1
1870730;;you don't even know if this thing's gonna run.;;1
1870731;;it will. i think it's time we found out.;;1
1870732;;here, use this power charge. yes, sir!;;1
1870733;;come on, kitster. let's move away.;;1
1870736;;uh, hey. my tongue is fat. ani!;;1
1870737;;you're quite right. he's very odd indeed.;;1
1870740;;it's working! it's working!;;1
1870741;;stay still, ani. let me clean this cut.;;1
1870742;;there's so many. do they all have a system of planets?;;1
1870744;;has anyone been to 'em all?;;1
1870746;;i wanna be the first one to see 'em all.;;1
1870748;;there we are. good as new.;;1
1870749;;ani, i'm not gonna tell you again.;;1
1870750;;what are you doing? checking your blood for infections.;;1
1870751;;go on. you have a big day tomorrow.;;1
1870754;;i need an analysis of this blood sample i'm sending you.;;1
1870756;;i need a midi-chlorian count.;;1
1870757;;the reading is off the chart.;;1
1870759;;even master yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high.;;1
1870761;;what does that mean?;;1
1870763;;i wanna see your spaceship the moment the race is over.;;1
1870764;;patience, my blue friend. you'll have your winnings before the suns set.;;1
1870765;;and we'll be far away from here.;;1
1870766;;not if your ship belongs to me, i think, huh?;;1
1870767;;i warn you, no funny business.;;1
1870768;;you don't think anakin can win? don't get me wrong, no.;;1
1870769;;i have great faith in the boy.;;1
1870770;;he's a credit to your race,;;1
1870771;;but, uh, sebulba there is going to win, i think.;;1
1870773;;why do you think that?;;1
1870775;;i am betting heavily on sebulba.;;1
1870776;;- i'll take that bet. - you what?;;1
1870777;;i'll wager my new racing pod against, say,;;1
1870778;;the boy and his mother.;;1
1870779;;no pod is worth two slaves, not by a long shot.;;1
1870782;;we'll let fate decide, huh?;;1
1870783;;i just happen to have a chance cube here.;;1
1870784;;blue, it's the boy.;;1
1870785;;red, uh... his mother.;;1
1870786;;you won this small toss, outlander, but you won't win the race!;;1
1870787;;so it makes little difference!;;1
1870788;;better stop your friend's betting or i'll end up owning him too.;;1
1870789;;what'd he mean by that? i'll tell you later.;;1
1870792;;space travel sounds rather perilous.;;1
1870793;;i can assure you, they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships.;;1
1870794;;this is so wizard, ani. i'm sure you'll do it this time.;;1
1870795;;- do what? - finish the race, of course.;;1
1870796;;- you've never won a race? - well, not exactly.;;1
1870798;;kitster's right. i will this time.;;1
1870799;;of course you will.;;1
1870802;;and a big turnout here from all corners of the outer rim territories.;;1
1870803;;i see the contestants are making their way out onto the starting grid.;;1
1870804;;i see ben quadinaros from the tund system.;;1
1870805;;two-time winner boles roor.;;1
1870807;;and in the front row, nearside pole position,;;1
1870810;;to clegg holdfast and his voltec kt9 wasp!;;1
1870812;;and back again, it's the mighty dud bolt...;;1
1870813;;with that incredible racing machine, the vulptereen 327.;;1
1870814;;and hoping for a big win today,;;1
1870815;;ody mandrell, with his record-setting pit droid team.;;1
1870816;;and a late entry, young anakin skywalker,;;1
1870818;;i see the flags are moving out onto the track.;;1
1870822;;i will, mom. i promise.;;1
1870824;;you won't walk away from this one...;;1
1870826;;don't count on it, slime ball.;;1
1870828;;you all set, ani? yep.;;1
1870830;;remember, concentrate on the moment.;;1
1870831;;feel, don't think. use your instincts.;;1
1870833;;may the force be with you.;;1
1870838;;hey, it looks like they're clearing the grid.;;1
1870839;;is he nervous? he's fine.;;1
1870840;;you jedi are far too reckless. the queen is not...;;1
1870841;;the queen trusts my judgment, young handmaiden.;;1
1870843;;you assume too much.;;1
1870845;;oh, dissen gonna be messy. me no watch'n!;;1
1870848;;wait. little skywalker has stalled.;;1
1870849;;well, it looks like quadinaros is having engine trouble also.;;1
1870851;;- and there goes skywalker! - go, ani, go!;;1
1870852;;he will be hard-pressed to catch up with the leaders.;;1
1870855;;looks like a few tusken raiders are camped out on the canyon dune turn.;;1
1870857;;ooh, there goes quadinaros' power coupling.;;1
1870860;;- chubba ni chees sebulba! - paketa!;;1
1870862;;ody mandrell coona wa wunda dungo!;;1
1870866;;where is master anakin?;;1
1870867;;look. here he comes.;;1
1870868;;it looks like skywalker is moving up in the field.;;1
1870870;;he has to complete two more circuits?;;1
1870875;;skywalker's spinning out of control!;;1
1870876;;oh, i don't care what universe you're from. that's gotta hurt!;;1
1870877;;here he comes! owoo!;;1
1870878;;at the start of the final lap, sebulba's in the lead,;;1
1870879;;followed closely by skywalker!;;1
1870881;;skywalker's been forced onto the service ramp!;;1
1870884;;- it's skywalker! - sebulba!;;1
1870885;;amazing! a quick control thrust, and he's back on course!;;1
1870888;;skywalker's in trouble! sebulba takes the lead!;;1
1870889;;he's catching sebulba! inkabunga!;;1
1870890;;careful, ani. careful, ani!;;1
1870892;;that little human being is out of his mind. punda tah punda!;;1
1870893;;they're side by side! bangu du bangu!;;1
1870898;;ya eeka buta! whoo-hoo-hoo!;;1
1870899;;i can't believe it.;;1
1870900;;the crowds are going nuts!;;1
1870901;;oh! ah! oh! ah!;;1
1870902;;ooh! ah! ooh! ah! ooh! ah! ooh! ah!;;1
1870904;;mom, i did it! yeah!;;1
1870907;;we owe you everything, ani.;;1
1870909;;it's so wonderful, ani.;;1
1870910;;you have brought hope to those who have none.;;1
1870911;;i'm so very proud of you.;;1
1870916;;you knew the boy was going to win. somehow you knew it.;;1
1870918;;whenever you gamble, my friend, eventually you'll lose.;;1
1870919;;bring the parts to the main hangar.;;1
1870920;;i'll come by your shop later on so you can release the boy.;;1
1870921;;you can't have him. it wasn't a fair bet.;;1
1870922;;would you like to discuss it with the hutts?;;1
1870923;;i'm sure they can settle this.;;1
1870926;;well, we have all the essential parts we need.;;1
1870927;;i'm going back. some unfinished business. i won't be long.;;1
1870928;;why do i sense we've picked up another pathetic life-form?;;1
1870929;;it's the boy who's responsible for getting us these parts.;;1
1870930;;get this hyper-drive generator installed.;;1
1870931;;yes, master. that shouldn't take long.;;1
1870933;;hey. these are yours.;;1
1870935;;mom, we sold the pod!;;1
1870936;;look at all the money we have! my goodness!;;1
1870937;;but that's so wonderful, ani. and he has been freed.;;1
1870938;;- what? - you're no longer a slave.;;1
1870939;;did you hear that?;;1
1870940;;now you can make your dreams come true, ani.;;1
1870942;;will you take him with you?;;1
1870943;;is he to become a jedi? yes.;;1
1870944;;our meeting was not a coincidence.;;1
1870945;;nothing happens by accident.;;1
1870946;;you mean i get to come with you in your starship?;;1
1870948;;training to become a jedi is not an easy challenge,;;1
1870949;;and even if you succeed, it's a hard life.;;1
1870950;;but i wanna go. it's what i've always dreamed of doing.;;1
1870951;;can i go, mom?;;1
1870953;;this path has been placed before you.;;1
1870954;;the choice is yours alone.;;1
1870955;;i wanna do it.;;1
1870956;;then pack your things. we haven't much time.;;1
1870959;;is she free too?;;1
1870960;;i tried to free your mother, ani, but watto wouldn't have it.;;1
1870961;;you're coming with us, aren't you, mom?;;1
1870962;;son, my place is here. my future is here.;;1
1870963;;it is time for you to let go.;;1
1870964;;i don't want things to change.;;1
1870965;;but you can't stop the change...;;1
1870966;;any more than you can stop the suns from setting.;;1
1870967;;oh, i love you.;;1
1870970;;i'll watch after him. you have my word.;;1
1870971;;will you be all right?;;1
1870973;;oh! oh, my. oh!;;1
1870975;;well, 3po, i've been freed...;;1
1870976;;and i'm going away in a starship.;;1
1870977;;master anakin, you are my maker and i wish you well.;;1
1870978;;however, i should prefer it if i were a little more completed.;;1
1870979;;i'm sorry i wasn't able to finish you, 3po, give you coverings and all.;;1
1870980;;i'm gonna miss working on you. you've been a great pal.;;1
1870981;;i'll make sure mom doesn't sell you or anything.;;1
1870985;;i can't do it, mom. i just can't do it.;;1
1870987;;will i ever see you again?;;1
1870988;;what does your heart tell you?;;1
1870992;;then we will see each other again.;;1
1870993;;i will come back and free you, mom.;;1
1870996;;and don't look back.;;1
1870998;;- qui-gon, sir, wait! i'm tired! - anakin! drop!;;1
1870999;;go! tell them to take off!;;1
1871002;;over there. fly low.;;1
1871003;;are you all right?;;1
1871006;;i'm not sure, but it was well-trained in the jedi arts.;;1
1871007;;my guess is it was after the queen.;;1
1871008;;what are we gonna do about it?;;1
1871009;;we shall be patient.;;1
1871010;;anakin skyalker, meet obi-wan kenobi.;;1
1871012;;you're a jedi too? pleased to meet you.;;1
1871013;;your queen is lost, your people are starving,;;1
1871014;;and you, governor, are going to die...;;1
1871015;;much sooner than your people, i'm afraid.;;1
1871016;;this invasion will gain you nothing.;;1
1871017;;we're a democracy. the people have decided.;;1
1871019;;my troops are in position to begin searching the swamps...;;1
1871020;;for these rumored underwater villages.;;1
1871021;;they will not stay hidden for long.;;1
1871022;;the death toll is catastrophic.;;1
1871023;;we must bow to their wishes.;;1
1871024;;you must contact me.;;1
1871027;;you come from a warm planet, ani.;;1
1871028;;a little too warm for my taste.;;1
1871031;;the queen is worried.;;1
1871032;;her people are suffering, dying.;;1
1871033;;she must convince the senate to intervene, or...;;1
1871034;;i'm not sure what'll happen.;;1
1871035;;i made this for you...;;1
1871036;;so you'd remember me.;;1
1871037;;i carved it out of a japor snippet.;;1
1871038;;it'll bring you good fortune.;;1
1871040;;but i don't need this to remember you by.;;1
1871041;;many things will change when we reach the capital, ani,;;1
1871042;;but my caring for you will remain.;;1
1871043;;i care for you, too, only i...;;1
1871045;;coruscant. the entire planet is one big city.;;1
1871046;;there's chancellor valorum's shuttle.;;1
1871047;;and look over there. senator palpatine is waiting for us.;;1
1871048;;it is a great gift to see you alive, your majesty.;;1
1871049;;with the communications breakdown, we've been very concerned.;;1
1871050;;i'm anxious to hear your report on the situation.;;1
1871051;;may i present supreme chancellor valorum.;;1
1871052;;welcome, your highness. it's an honor to finally meet you in person.;;1
1871053;;thank you, supreme chancellor.;;1
1871054;;i must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the current situation.;;1
1871055;;i've called for a special session of the senate to hear your position.;;1
1871056;;i'm grateful for your concern, chancellor.;;1
1871057;;there is a question of procedure,;;1
1871058;;but i'm confident we can overcome it.;;1
1871059;;i must speak with the jedi council immediately.;;1
1871060;;the situation has become much more complicated.;;1
1871062;;the queen's a bein' grossly nice, mesa tinks.;;1
1871064;;there is no civility, only politics.;;1
1871065;;the republic is not what it once was.;;1
1871066;;the senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates.;;1
1871067;;there is no interest...;;1
1871068;;in the common good.;;1
1871069;;i must be frank, your majesty.;;1
1871070;;there is little chance the senate will act on the invasion.;;1
1871071;;chancellor valorum seems to think there is hope.;;1
1871072;;if i may say so, your majesty, the chancellor has little real power.;;1
1871073;;he is mired by baseless accusations of corruption.;;1
1871074;;the bureaucrats are in charge now. what options have we?;;1
1871075;;our best choice would be to push for the election...;;1
1871076;;of a stronger supreme chancellor,;;1

1871078;;and give us justice.;;1

1871081;;he has been our strongest supporter.;;1
1871082;;our only other choice would be to submit a plea to the courts.;;1
1871083;;the courts take even longer to decide things than the senate.;;1
1871084;;our people are dying, senator.;;1
1871085;;we must do something quickly to stop the federation.;;1
1871086;;to be realistic, your majesty,;;1
1871087;;i think we're going to have to accept federation control for the time being.;;1
1871088;;that is something i cannot do.;;1
1871089;;he was trained in the jedi arts.;;1
1871090;;my only conclusion can be that it was a sith lord.;;1
1871091;;impossible. the sith have been extinct for a millennium.;;1

1871102;;located around a person?;;1
1871104;;his cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians i have seen in a life-form.;;1
1871105;;it is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians.;;1

1871107;;of the one who will bring balance to the force.;;1

1871558;;qui-gon believed in him.;;1

1871561;;grave danger i fear in his training.;;1
1871562;;master yoda, i gave qui-gon my word.;;1
1871563;;i will train anakin.;;1
1871565;;without the approval of the council, if i must.;;1
1871566;;qui-gon's defiance i sense in you.;;1

1871568;;agree with you the council does.;;1

1871576;;a master and an apprentice.;;1

3875852;;master, general grievous's ship is directly ahead...;;1
3875853;;the one crawling with vulture droids.;;1
3875854;;oh, i see it. oh, this is going to be easy.;;1
3875855;;- oddball, do you copy? - copy, red leader.;;1

3875863;;no, they are doing their job so we can do ours.;;1

3875875;;- move to the right so i can get a clear shot at them. - the mission.;;1
3875876;;get to the command ship. get the chancellor. i'm running out of tricks here.;;1
3875877;;oh! in the name of...;;1
3875878;;- hold your fire! you're not helping here. - i agree. bad idea.;;1
3875879;;i can't see a thing. my cockpit's fogging.;;1
3875880;;they're all over me. anakin!;;1
3875881;;- move to the right. - hold on, anakin. you're gonna get us both killed.;;1
3875882;;get out of here. there's nothing more you can do.;;1
3875883;;i'm not leaving without you, master.;;1
3875886;;r2, hit the buzz droid's center eye.;;1
3875887;;- yeah, you got him! - great, r2.;;1
3875888;;the general's command ship is dead ahead.;;1
3875889;;well, haveyou noticed the shields are still up?;;1
3875891;;oh, i have a bad feeling about this.;;1

3875896;;i sense count dooku.;;1
3875897;;- i sense a trap. - next move?;;1
3875899;;r2, go back. i need you to stay with the ship.;;1
3875900;;here. take this and wait for orders.;;1
3875901;;what's the situation, captain?;;1
3875902;;two jedi have landed in the main hangar bay. we're tracking them.;;1
3875903;;just as count dooku predicted.;;1
3875905;;drop your weapons. i said drop 'em.;;1
3875906;;- roger. - roger, roger.;;1
3875908;;those are jedi fighters all right.;;1
3875909;;- did you press the stop button? - no. did you?;;1
3875910;;- no. - well, there's more than one way out of here.;;1
3875911;;we don't want to get out.;;1
3875912;;we want to get moving. r2, activate elevator 31174.;;1
3875913;;- come in, r2. - what that?;;1
3875914;;r2, do you copy?;;1
3875915;;r2, activate the elevator number...;;1
3875917;;get back to work. that nothin'.;;1

3875920;;always on the move.;;1
3875921;;r2, switch on the comlink.;;1
3875922;;r2, can you hear me?;;1
3875926;;stop. stop. r2, we need to be going up.;;1
3875928;;r2, do you copy?;;1
3875929;;r2, do you hear me? r2, we need to be going up, not down.;;1
3875932;;you stupid little astro droid.;;1
3875935;;my eyes! my eyes!;;1
3875936;;- what was that all about? - well, r2 has been...;;1
3875937;;- uh, no loose wire jokes. - did i say anything?;;1
3875938;;- he's trying. - i didn't say anything.;;1
3875939;;- chancellor. - are you all right?;;1
3875941;;- this time we will do it together. - i was about to say that.;;1
3875942;;get help. you're no match for him. he's a sith lord.;;1
3875943;;chancellor palpatine, sith lords are our speciality.;;1
3875945;;we don't want to make a mess of things in front of the chancellor.;;1
3875946;;you won't get away this time, dooku.;;1
3875947;;i've been looking forward to this.;;1
3875948;;my powers have doubled since the last time we met, count.;;1
3875949;;good. twice the pride, double the fall.;;1
3875951;;i sense great fear in you, skywalker.;;1
3875952;;you have hate. you have anger.;;1
3875953;;butyou don't use them.;;1
3875959;;you did well, anakin.;;1
3875960;;he was too dangerous to be kept alive.;;1
3875961;;yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.;;1
3875962;;i shouldn't have done that. it's not the jedi way.;;1
3875963;;it is only natural. he cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge.;;1
3875964;;it wasn't the first time, anakin.;;1
3875965;;remember what you told me about your mother and the sand people?;;1
3875966;;now we must leave before more security droids arrive.;;1
3875967;;anakin, there's no time.;;1
3875968;;we must get off this ship before it's too late.;;1
3875969;;- he seems to be all right. - leave him, or we'll never make it.;;1
3875970;;his fate will be the same as ours.;;1
3875972;;all batteries, fire! fire!;;1
3875974;;r2, activate elevator 3224.;;1
3875975;;- reverse stabilizers. - reversing stabilizers.;;1
3875977;;fire the emergency booster engines.;;1
3875978;;we're leveling out, sir.;;1
3875980;;easy. we're in a bit of a situation here.;;1
3875981;;- did i miss something? - hold on.;;1
3875982;;- what is that? - uh, oops.;;1
3875983;;r2. r2, shut down the elevator.;;1
3875985;;let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable.;;1
3875986;;r2, get down here.;;1
3875988;;general, we found the jedi.;;1
3875989;;- they're in hallway 328. - activate ray shields.;;1
3875991;;wait a minute. how did this happen?;;1
3875992;;- we're smarter than this. - apparently not.;;1
3875993;;- i say patience. - patience?;;1
3875994;;yes. r2 will be along in a few moments...;;1
3875995;;and then... he'll release the ray shields.;;1
3875999;;doyou have a plan "b"?;;1
3876000;;ah, yes. the negotiator.;;1
3876001;;general kenobi. we've been waiting for you.;;1
3876003;;- that wasn't much of a rescue. - you're welcome.;;1
3876006;;i was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little... older.;;1
3876007;;general grievous. you're shorter than i expected.;;1
3876009;;we have a job to do, anakin. try not to upset him.;;1
3876010;;your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.;;1
3876011;;not this time. and this time, you won't escape.;;1
3876016;;- stay at your stations! - whoa!;;1
3876017;;get him! get him!;;1
3876020;;- don't bother with them. keep the ship in orbit. - yes, sir.;;1
3876021;;you lose, general kenobi.;;1
3876022;;get out ofhere! run!;;1
3876023;;time to abandon ship.;;1
3876024;;all the escape pods have been launched.;;1
3876025;;grievous. can you fly a cruiser like this?;;1
3876026;;- you mean, do i know how to land what's left of this thing? - well?;;1
3876027;;well, under the circumstances, i'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.;;1
3876029;;open all hatches. extend all flaps and drag fins.;;1
3876031;;not to worry. we are still flying half a ship.;;1
3876032;;now we're really picking up speed.;;1
3876034;;- we're in the atmosphere. - grab that. keep us level.;;1
3876037;;5000. fire ships on the left and the right.;;1
3876038;;- we'll take you in. - copy that.;;1
3876039;;- landing strip, straight ahead. - we're coming in too hot.;;1
3876041;;- areyou coming, master? - oh, no. i'm not brave enough for politics.;;1
3876042;;i have to report to the council.;;1
3876043;;besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.;;1
3876044;;hold on. this whole operation was your idea.;;1
3876045;;let us not forget, anakin, that you rescued me from the buzz droids.;;1
3876046;;and you killed count dooku, and you rescued the chancellor...;;1
3876047;;carrying me unconscious on your back.;;1
3876048;;all because of your training.;;1
3876049;;anakin, let's be fair. today you were the hero...;;1
3876050;;and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.;;1
3876051;;all right. but you owe me one, and not for saving your skin for the 10th time.;;1
3876052;;ninth time. that business on cato neimoidia doesn't...doesn't count.;;1
3876053;;i'll see you at the briefing.;;1
3876054;;chancellor palpatine, are you all right?;;1
3876055;;yes. thanks to your two jedi knights.;;1
3876056;;they killed count dooku, but general grievous has escaped once again.;;1
3876057;;general grievous will run and hide, as he always does. he's a coward.;;1
3876058;;but with count dooku dead, he is the leader of the droid army.;;1
3876059;;and i assure you, the senate will vote to continue the war as long as grievous is alive.;;1
3876060;;then the jedi council will make finding grievous our highest priority.;;1
3876061;;- watch it. - excuse me.;;1
3876062;;- come along, r2. - the republic cannot praise you enough.;;1
3876063;;thank you, senator organa.;;1
3876064;;well, it couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.;;1
3876065;;now there i agree with you.;;1
3876066;;in fact, i could do with a tune-up myself.;;1
3876067;;but the fighting will continue until general grievous is spare parts.;;1
3876068;;well, i will do everything i can in the senate.;;1
3876069;;- excuse me. - certainly.;;1
3876071;;i've missed you, padmé.;;1
3876072;;there were whispers that you'd been killed.;;1
3876074;;it feels like we've been apart for a lifetime.;;1
3876075;;and it might have been, ifthe chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.;;1
3876076;;i don't think they would have ever brought us back from the outer rim sieges.;;1
3876077;;- wait. not here. - yes, here.;;1
3876078;;i'm...i'm tired of all this deception. i don't care if they know we're married.;;1
3876079;;anakin, don't say things like that.;;1
3876080;;areyou all right? you're trembling.;;1
3876082;;something wonderful has happened.;;1
3876085;;well, that's won... that's wonderful.;;1
3876086;;what are we gonna do?;;1
3876087;;we're not gonna worry about anything right now. all right?;;1
3876088;;this is a happy moment.;;1
3876089;;the happiest moment of my life.;;1
3876092;;i suggest you move the separatist leaders to mustafar.;;1
3876093;;it will be done, my lord.;;1
3876094;;the end of the war is near, general.;;1
3876095;;but the loss ofcount dooku...;;1
3876096;;his death was a necessary loss.;;1
3876097;;soon i will have a new apprentice...;;1
3876098;;one far younger and more powerful.;;1
3876099;;ani, i want to have our baby back home on naboo.;;1
3876100;;we can go to the lake country where no one will know...;;1
3876101;;where we can be safe.;;1
3876102;;i can go early and fix up the baby's room.;;1
3876103;;i know the perfect spot. right by the gardens.;;1
3876104;;you are so... beautiful.;;1
3876105;;it's only because i'm so in love.;;1
3876107;;no, it's because i'm so in love with you.;;1
3876108;;so love has blinded you?;;1
3876109;;well, that's not exactly what i meant.;;1
3876110;;but it's probably true.;;1
3876114;;i remember when i gave this toyou.;;1
3876115;;how long is it gonna take for us to be honest with each other?;;1
3876116;;it was a dream.;;1
3876118;;like the ones i used to have about my mother...;;1
3876119;;just before she died.;;1
3876121;;and it was about you.;;1
3876123;;it was only a dream.;;1
3876124;;you die in childbirth.;;1
3876127;;it was only a dream.;;1
3876128;;i won't let this one become real.;;1
3876129;;this baby will change our lives.;;1
3876130;;i doubt the queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate.;;1
3876131;;and if the council discovers you're the father, you'll be expelled...;;1
3876132;;i...i know. i know.;;1
3876133;;doyou think obi-wan might be able to help us?;;1
3876134;;we don't need his help.;;1
3876135;;our baby is a blessing.;;1
3876138;;they're of pain, suffering.;;1
3876140;;yourselfyou speak of, or someoneyou know?;;1
3876144;;careful you must be when sensing the future, anakin.;;1
3876145;;the fear of loss is a path to the dark side.;;1
3876146;;i won't let these visions come true, master yoda.;;1
3876147;;death is a natural part of life.;;1
3876148;;rejoice for those around you who transform into the force.;;1
3876149;;mourn them, do not. miss them, do not.;;1
3876150;;attachment leads to jealousy.;;1
3876151;;the shadow of greed that is.;;1
3876152;;what must i do, master yoda?;;1
3876153;;train yourself to let go...;;1
3876154;;of everything you fear to lose.;;1
3876155;;you've missed the report on the outer rim sieges.;;1
3876156;;i'm sorry. i was held up.;;1
3876157;;- i have no excuse. - in short, they are going very well.;;1
3876158;;saleucami has fallen, and master vos has moved his troops to boz pity.;;1
3876160;;the senate is expected...;;1
3876161;;to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today.;;1
3876162;;well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. is that bad?;;1
3876163;;it'll make it easier for us to end this war.;;1
3876164;;be careful of your friend palpatine.;;1
3876165;;be careful of what?;;1
3876166;;- he has requested your presence. - what for?;;1
3876167;;- he would not say. - he didn't inform the council?;;1
3876168;;- that's unusual, isn't it? - all of this is unusual.;;1
3876169;;and it's making me feel uneasy.;;1
3876170;;i hope you trust me, anakin.;;1
3876172;;i need your help, son.;;1
3876173;;what do you mean?;;1
3876174;;- i'm depending on you. - for what? i don't understand.;;1
3876175;;to be the eyes, ears and voice ofthe republic.;;1
3876177;;i'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the jedi council.;;1
3876180;;but the council elects its own members. they'll never accept this.;;1
3876181;;i think they will. they need you.;;1
3876182;;more than you know.;;1
3876183;;allow this appointment lightly the council does not.;;1
3876184;;disturbing is this move by chancellor palpatine.;;1
3876186;;you are on this council, but we do not grant you the rank of master.;;1
3876188;;how can you do this? this is outrageous.;;1
3876190;;how can you be on the council and not be a master?;;1
3876191;;take a seat, young skywalker.;;1
3876193;;we have surveyed all systems in the republic...;;1
3876194;;but have found no sign of general grievous.;;1
3876195;;hiding in the outer rim grievous is.;;1
3876196;;the outlying systems you must sweep.;;1
3876197;;we do not have many ships to spare.;;1
3876198;;what about the droid attack on the wookiees?;;1
3876199;;it is critical we send an attack group there immediately.;;1
3876200;;he's right. it's a system we cannot afford to lose.;;1
3876202;;good relations with the wookiees i have.;;1
3876203;;it's settled then. yoda will take a battalion of clones...;;1
3876204;;to reinforce the wookiees on kashyyyk.;;1
3876205;;may the force be with us all.;;1
3876206;;what kind of nonsense is this?;;1
3876207;;put me on the council and not make me a master?;;1
3876208;;it's never been done in the history of the jedi. it's insulting.;;1
3876209;;oh, calm down, anakin. you have been given a great honor.;;1
3876210;;to be on the council atyour age... it's never happened before.;;1
3876211;;the fact of the matter is you are too close to the chancellor.;;1
3876212;;the council doesn't like it when he interferes in jedi affairs.;;1
3876213;;- i swear to you, i didn't ask to be put on the council. - but it's what you wanted.;;1
3876214;;your friendship with chancellor palpatine seems to have paid off.;;1
3876215;;that has nothing to do with this.;;1
3876216;;the only reason the council has approved your appointment...;;1
3876217;;is because the chancellor trusts you.;;1
3876218;;- and? - anakin, i am on your side.;;1
3876219;;- i didn't want to putyou in this situation. - what situation?;;1
3876220;;the council wants you to report on all the chancellor's dealings.;;1
3876221;;they want to know what he's up to.;;1
3876222;;they want me to spy on the chancellor?;;1
3876223;;- but that's treason. - we are at war, anakin.;;1
3876224;;why didn't the council give me this assignment when we were in session?;;1
3876225;;this assignment is not to be on record.;;1
3876226;;the chancellor is not a bad man, obi-wan.;;1
3876227;;he befriended me. he's watched out for me ever since i arrived here.;;1
3876228;;that is why you must help us.;;1
3876229;;anakin, our allegiance is to the senate, not to its leader...;;1
3876230;;who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.;;1
3876231;;the senate demanded that he stay longer.;;1
3876232;;yes, but use your feelings, anakin. something is out of place.;;1
3876233;;you're asking me to do something against the jedi code...;;1
3876234;;against the republic, against a mentor and a friend.;;1
3876235;;that's what's out of place here. why are you asking this ofme?;;1
3876236;;the council is asking you.;;1
3876237;;anakin did not take to his new assignment with much enthusiasm.;;1
3876238;;it's very dangerous, putting them together.;;1
3876239;;i don't think the boy can handle it.;;1
3876240;;i don't trust him.;;1
3876241;;with all due respect, master, is he not the chosen one?;;1
3876242;;is he not to destroy the sith and bring balance to the force?;;1
3876243;;so the prophecy says.;;1
3876244;;a prophecy that misread could have been.;;1
3876245;;he will not let me down.;;1
3876247;;i hope right you are.;;1
3876248;;sometimes i wonder what's happening to the jedi order.;;1
3876249;;i think this war is destroying the principles of the republic.;;1
3876250;;have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?;;1
3876251;;what do you mean?;;1
3876252;;what if the democracywe thought we were serving no longer exists...;;1
3876253;;and the republic has become the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?;;1
3876254;;i don't believe that.;;1
3876255;;and you're sounding like a separatist.;;1
3876256;;this war represents a failure to listen.;;1
3876257;;nowyou're closer to the chancellor than anyone.;;1
3876258;;please, ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.;;1
3876259;;don't ask me to do that.;;1
3876260;;make a motion in the senate, where that kind ofa request belongs.;;1
3876261;;- what is it? - nothing.;;1
3876262;;don't do this. don't shut me out. let me help you.;;1
3876264;;like you did by the lake on naboo.;;1
3876265;;so long ago, when there was nothing but our love.;;1
3876266;;no politics, no plotting, nowar.;;1
3876267;;- you wanted to see me, chancellor. - yes, anakin. come closer.;;1
3876268;;i have good news.;;1
3876269;;our clone intelligence units have discovered the location of general grievous.;;1
3876270;;he's hiding in the utapau system.;;1
3876272;;we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.;;1
3876273;;i would worry about the collective wisdom of the council...;;1
3876274;;if it didn't select you for this assignment.;;1
3876275;;you're the best choice, by far.;;1
3876279;;you know i'm not able to rely on the jedi council.;;1
3876280;;if they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.;;1
3876281;;i'm not sure i understand.;;1
3876282;;you must sense what i have come to suspect.;;1
3876283;;the jedi council want control ofthe republic.;;1
3876284;;they're planning to betray me.;;1
3876285;;- i don't think that... - anakin.;;1
3876287;;you know, don't you?;;1
3876288;;- i know they don't trust you. - hmm. or the senate.;;1
3876289;;or the republic, or democracy, for that matter.;;1
3876290;;i have to admit, my trust in them has been shaken.;;1
3876292;;they asked you to do something...;;1
3876293;;that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?;;1
3876294;;they asked you to spy on me, didn't they?;;1
3876296;;i don't know what to say.;;1
3876297;;remember back to your early teachings.;;1
3876298;;all who gain power are afraid to lose it.;;1
3876299;;- even the jedi. - the jedi use their power for good.;;1
3876300;;good is a point of view, anakin.;;1
3876301;;the sith and the jedi are similar in almost everyway...;;1
3876302;;including their quest for greater power.;;1
3876303;;the sith rely on their passion for their strength.;;1
3876304;;they think inwards... only about themselves.;;1
3876305;;and the jedi don't?;;1
3876306;;the jedi are selfless. they only care about others.;;1
3876307;;-=the last fantasy=- proudly presents;;1
3876308;;did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise?;;1
3876309;;- no. - i thought not.;;1
3876310;;it's not a story the jedi would tell you.;;1
3876311;;it's a sith legend.;;1
3876313;;was a dark lord of the sith so powerful and so wise...;;1
3876314;;he could use the force to influence the midi-chlorians...;;1
3876316;;he had such a knowledge ofthe dark side...;;1
3876317;;he could even keep the ones he cared about...;;1
3876319;;he could actually... save people from death?;;1
3876320;;the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities...;;1
3876321;;some consider to be unnatural.;;1
3876322;;wh...what happened to him?;;1
3876323;;he became so powerful...;;1
3876324;;the only thing he was afraid of was...;;1
3876326;;which eventually, of course, he did.;;1
3876327;;unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew.;;1
3876328;;then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.;;1
3876330;;he could save others from death...;;1
3876332;;is it possible to learn this power?;;1
3876333;;not from a jedi.;;1
3876335;;palpatine thinks general grievous is on utapau?;;1
3876336;;a partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet...;;1
3876337;;- from the chairman of utapau. - hmm.;;1
3876338;;act on this we must.;;1
3876339;;the capture of general grievous will end this war.;;1
3876340;;quickly and decisively we should proceed.;;1
3876341;;the chancellor has requested... that i lead the campaign.;;1
3876342;;the council will make up its own mind who is to go...;;1
3876344;;a master is needed, with more experience.;;1
3876345;;i concur. master kenobi should go.;;1
3876346;;- i agree. - aye.;;1
3876349;;the droids have started up their main power generators.;;1
3876350;;- then now the time is, commander. - yes, sir.;;1
3876353;;- you're gonna need me on this one, master. - oh, i agree.;;1
3876354;;- however, it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase. - master.;;1
3876355;;i've disappointed you. uh, i haven't been very appreciative ofyour training.;;1
3876356;;i've been arrogant, and i apologize.;;1
3876357;;i've just been so frustrated with the council.;;1
3876358;;you are strong and wise, anakin, and i am very proud of you.;;1
3876359;;i have trained you since you were a small boy.;;1
3876360;;i have taught you everything i know.;;1
3876361;;and you have become a far greater jedi than i could ever hope to be.;;1
3876362;;but be patient, anakin.;;1
3876363;;it will not be long before the council makes you a jedi master.;;1
3876364;;obi-wan. may the force be with you.;;1
3876365;;good-bye, old friend. may the force be with you.;;1
3876366;;fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here.;;1
3876367;;- on the far side. - i'll keep them distracted until you get there.;;1
3876368;;- just don't take too long. - come on. when have i ever let you down?;;1
3876370;;the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids until you arrive.;;1
3876373;;don't give up, padmé.;;1
3876374;;obi-wan's been here, hasn't he?;;1
3876375;;he came by this morning.;;1
3876376;;what did he want?;;1
3876377;;he's worried about you.;;1
3876378;;he says you've been under a lot of stress.;;1
3876380;;lost? what do you mean?;;1
3876381;;obi-wan and the council don't trust me.;;1
3876382;;they trustyou with their lives.;;1
3876384;;i'm not the jedi i should be.;;1
3876386;;and i know i shouldn't.;;1
3876387;;you expect too much of yourself.;;1
3876388;;- i found a way to save you. - save me?;;1
3876390;;is that what's bothering you?;;1
3876391;;i won't lose you, padmé.;;1
3876392;;i'm not gonna die in childbirth, ani.;;1
3876393;;i promise you. no, i promise you.;;1
3876395;;what brings you to our remote sanctuary?;;1
3876397;;there's no war here... unless you brought it with you.;;1
3876398;;with your kind permission, i should like some fuel...;;1
3876399;;and to use your city as a base as i search nearby systems for general grievous.;;1
3876400;;he is here. we are being held hostage.;;1
3876401;;- they are watching us. - i understand.;;1
3876402;;tenth level, thousands of battle droids.;;1
3876403;;tell your people to take shelter.;;1
3876404;;if you have warriors, now is the time.;;1
3876405;;take the fighter back to the ship. tell cody i've made contact.;;1
3876406;;- is he bringing additional warriors? - he didn't say.;;1
3876407;;it won't be long before the armies of the republic track us here.;;1
3876408;;i am sending you to the mustafar system in the outerrim.;;1
3876409;;it is a volcanic planet.;;1
3876410;;- you will be safe there. - safe?;;1
3876411;;hmph! chancellor palpatine managed to escape your grip, general.;;1
3876412;;without count dooku, i have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.;;1
3876414;;you have not found yourself in my grip.;;1
3876415;;your ship is waiting.;;1
3876418;;you are a bold one.;;1
3876421;;i will deal with this jedi slime myself.;;1
3876424;;i've been trained in your jedi arts by count dooku.;;1
3876427;;you must realize you are doomed.;;1
3876428;;oh, i don't think so.;;1
3876432;;master windu, may i interrupt?;;1
3876433;;general kenobi has made contact with general grievous...;;1
3876434;;and we have begun our attack.;;1
3876436;;anakin, deliver this report to the chancellor.;;1
3876437;;his reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.;;1
3876439;;i sense a plot to destroy the jedi.;;1
3876440;;the dark side of the force surrounds the chancellor.;;1
3876441;;if he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of grievous...;;1
3876442;;then he should be removed from office.;;1
3876443;;the jedi council would have to take control of the senate...;;1
3876444;;in order to secure a peaceful transition.;;1
3876445;;to a dark place this line of thought will carry us.;;1
3876446;;hmm. great care we must take.;;1
3876448;;we've just received a report from master kenobi.;;1
3876449;;he has engaged general grievous.;;1
3876450;;we can only hope that master kenobi is up to the challenge.;;1
3876451;;i should be there with him.;;1
3876452;;it's upsetting to me to see that the council...;;1
3876453;;doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents.;;1
3876454;;don't you wonder why they won't make you a jedi master?;;1
3876455;;i wish i knew.;;1
3876456;;more and more i get the feeling that...;;1
3876457;;i'm being excluded from the council.;;1
3876458;;i know there are things about the force that they're not telling me.;;1
3876459;;they don't trust you, anakin.;;1
3876460;;they see your future.;;1
3876461;;they know your power will be too strong to control.;;1
3876462;;you must break through the fog of lies the jedi have created around you.;;1
3876463;;let me help you to know the subtleties of the force.;;1
3876464;;how do you know the ways ofthe force?;;1
3876465;;my mentor taught me everything about the force.;;1
3876466;;even the nature of the dark side.;;1
3876467;;you know the dark side?;;1
3876469;;if one is to understand the great mystery...;;1
3876470;;one must study all its aspects...;;1
3876471;;not just the dogmatic narrow view ofthejedi.;;1
3876472;;if you wish to become a complete and wise leader...;;1
3876473;;you must embrace a larger view of the force.;;1
3876474;;be careful of the jedi, anakin.;;1
3876476;;can you achieve a power greater than any jedi.;;1
3876477;;learn to know the dark side of the force...;;1
3876478;;and you will be able to save yourwife...;;1
3876480;;what did you say?;;1
3876481;;use my knowledge. i beg you.;;1
3876482;;you're the sith lord.;;1
3876483;;i know what's been troubling you. listen to me.;;1
3876484;;don't continue to be a pawn of the jedi council.;;1
3876485;;ever since i've known you, you've been searching for a life...;;1
3876486;;greater than that ofan ordinary jedi.;;1
3876487;;a life of significance...;;1
3876489;;- areyou going to kill me? - i would certainly like to.;;1
3876490;;i know you would.;;1
3876491;;i can feel your anger.;;1
3876492;;it gives you focus...;;1
3876494;;- i'm going to turn you over to the jedi council. - of course. you should.;;1
3876495;;but you're not sure of their intentions, areyou?;;1
3876496;;i will quickly discover the truth of all this.;;1
3876497;;you have great wisdom, anakin.;;1
3876498;;know the power of the dark side.;;1
3876499;;power to save padmé.;;1
3876502;;master windu, i must talk to you.;;1
3876503;;skywalker, we just received word that obi-wan has destroyed general grievous.;;1
3876504;;we're on our way to make sure the chancellor returns emergency power back to the senate.;;1
3876505;;he won't give up his power. i've just learned a terrible truth.;;1
3876506;;i think chancellor palpatine is a sith lord.;;1
3876508;;yes. the one we've been looking for.;;1
3876509;;- how do you know this? - he knows the ways of the force.;;1
3876510;;he's been trained to use the dark side.;;1
3876511;;- are you sure? - absolutely.;;1
3876512;;then our worst fears have been realized.;;1
3876513;;we must move quickly if the jedi order is to survive.;;1
3876514;;master, the chancellor is very powerful.;;1
3876515;;you'll need my help if you're going to arrest him.;;1
3876516;;for you own good, stay out ofthis affair.;;1
3876517;;i sense a great deal of confusion in you, young skywalker.;;1
3876518;;there is much fear that clouds your judgment.;;1
3876519;;- i must go, master. - no.;;1
3876520;;if what you've told me is true...;;1
3876521;;you will have gained my trust.;;1
3876522;;but for now, remain here.;;1
3876523;;wait in the council chambers until we return.;;1
3876525;;you do know, don't you...;;1
3876526;;if the jedi destroy me...;;1
3876527;;any chance of saving her will be lost.;;1
3876528;;master windu. i take it general grievous has been destroyed then.;;1
3876529;;i must say you're here sooner than expected.;;1
3876530;;in the name of the galactic senate of the republic...;;1
3876531;;you're under arrest, chancellor.;;1
3876532;;are you threatening me, master jedi?;;1
3876533;;the senate will decide your fate.;;1
3876534;;- i am the senate. - not yet.;;1
3876536;;you are under arrest, my lord.;;1
3876537;;anakin, i told you it would come to this.;;1
3876539;;the jedi are taking over.;;1
3876540;;the oppression of the sith will never return.;;1
3876543;;no. no. you will die!;;1
3876545;;he is the traitor!;;1
3876546;;i have the power to save the one you love.;;1

3876591;;because the council did not trust you, my young apprentice...;;1
3876592;;i believe you are the only jedi with no knowledge of this plot.;;1
3876593;;when the jedi learn what has transpired here...;;1
3876594;;they will kill us...;;1
3876595;;along with all the senators.;;1

3876599;;including your friend obi-wan kenobi...;;1

3876702;;that's why i went looking for yoda.;;1
3876703;;have we had any contact from the temple?;;1
3876704;;received a coded retreat message we have.;;1
3876705;;it requests all jedi to return to the temple.;;1
3876706;;- it says the war is over. - well, then we must go back.;;1
3876707;;if there are any stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.;;1
3876708;;hmm. suggest dismantling the coded signal, doyou?;;1
3876709;;yes, master. there is too much at stake.;;1
3876711;;and a little more knowledge might light ourway.;;1

3876713;;you have done well, viceroy.;;1
3876714;;when my new apprentice darth vader arrives...;;1

3876723;;without keeping the senate intact.;;1
3876724;;ifa special session of congress there is...;;1
3876725;;easier for us to enter the jedi temple it will be.;;1

3876727;;welcome, lord vader. we've been expecting you.;;1
3876728;;and the jedi rebellion has been foiled.;;1
3876729;;- what's happened? - the chancellor's been elaborating...;;1
3876730;;on a plot by the jedi to overthrow the senate.;;1
3876731;;the remaining jedi will be hunted down and defeated.;;1
3876732;;not even the younglings survived.;;1
3876733;;killed not by clones...;;1
3876735;;by a lightsaber he was.;;1
3876736;;who? who could have done this?;;1
3876737;;the attempt on my life...;;1

3876752;;lord sidious promised us peace. we onlywant...;;1
3876753;;i have recalibrated the code, warning all surviving jedi to stay away.;;1
3876755;;to discover the recalibration a long time it will take.;;1
3876757;;there is something i must know.;;1
3876758;;if into the security recordings you go...;;1
3876759;;only pain will you find.;;1
3876760;;i must know the truth, master.;;1

3876790;;not anakin. he couldn't.;;1
3876791;;he was deceived by a lie. we all were.;;1
